I sent my other brother | my youngest brother | down to== to the beach to get the other kids up up to the house. And we packed some belongings and somehow (..) we started off going toward Aleut town | through the what we called "the back trail". We then used the road next to the beach | we used the back trail. And we got to the Aleut townside and this called "Big Lake" (uh). There was probably six of us walking around the lake | and who should be running across the lake with the ice breaking up behind her | it was my mom | running carrying my baby sister.

When we got there | I mean there was ice all the ways around you know iceberg as in chunks of ice all over the house. And just in one corner the living room just got a little dump and that was it. Otherwise none of the== the shed or anything else got hurt.
