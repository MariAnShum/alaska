Do you have (uh) any brothers and sisters?
 
Rt 01:48
I have two sisters. One sister lives in Homer. Her name is Patti (..) Whelan | and one sister lives in California. Her name is Margie. And my brother Eli died (uh) 30 years ago in 1968 (..) on a crabbing exploratory in southeast Alaska. (..) And he in turn has four children | two boys and two girls. (..) And I&apos;m married and live in southeast Alaska with my wife. And we have three children | one daughter and two boys. (..) And my daughter has three girls | the oldest son has five kids (uh) | one girl and four boys. And my youngest son lives in Sitka | but his family lives in the Everett | Washington area. And he has four girls and one boy.
 
Ir 02:53
And (..) what year did you leave Afognak?
 
Rt 02:57
I left Afognak (uh) I would say 1946 | 1946 moved to Kodiak | entered school in Kodiak and went as far as the eighth grade in Kodiak. And then in 1949 moved to Sitka | went to management school (..) and graduated from high school there in 1953. Used to come up summers and sail and fish | ‹3› and Kodiak | and 53 was my last year fishing here | went back to Sitka and married my wife. And we will have== we&apos;ll have 45 years this November | and (..) still married. Believe it or not {laughs} | she hasn&apos;t kicked me out.
 
Ir 03:42
But can you describe your earliest memories of Afognak?
 
Rt 03:46
Oh boy. I&apos;ll tell you I have a lot of good memories of (uh)== of living there as a kid. I remember we used to raise ‹1› just always had rock fights with kids | you know. But for some reason we (uh) opted not to shoot above the knees. That was (uh) unwritten law for us to | you know | when you had rock fights | it was always through to the feet | but nobody ever got hit in the head. And we played a lot of games. I went to school and (uh) you might call== the school was in Aleut town | which is (uh) towards ‹2› the town there past the church | that was (uh) main school. And my teacher | first teacher | was Tom Carmody. (..) And the second one was (uh) Cameron. I don&apos;t remember his name now | his first name. Anyway him and his wife were both teaching | and he had a glass eye. Funny thing about him was we could always look at him and he&apos;d say | if my one eye is looking the other way | let me know so I can straighten it out. So {laughs} == so he always told us that (uh) with that glass eye of his. But he was ‹2› good teachers. Tom Carmody had a son | two sons. One of them was (uh) == his hair was totally white as a child. That&apos;s funny you know | just (uh) something I== I remember about that. In the summertime we always picked berries and played on the beach. When the== when the fish came in | streams would catch ‹2›. Or we&apos;d seen for (uh) beach ‹1› for (uh) reds. It reminded (uh) == my great uncle would split fish for (..) smoking and drying (..) in the [end].
 
Ir 05:31 
[Who] == who was your great uncle?
 
Rt 05:32
Yeah Nicholas | Nikolai Sheretin. And his== his wife was Fiona Sheretin | who has ties to people in Ouzinkie (uh). I see by the record that their name was Panameroff | but (uh) her brother John Kotelnikoff changed his name from Panameroff to Kotelnikoff. So (..) I just learned that yesterday downstairs.
 
Ir 06:00
You mentioned that (uh)== going to school in Aleut town. (uh) Which part of the village that you live in and what do you remember about how it was laid out?

Rt 12:39
Probably the == the most difficult was the loss of my parents | as a child | you know | and growing up knowing that (uh) they were gone and== and not having a mom and dad to (uh)== to fall back on | but still having my great uncle and== and grandparents to== to be close to all the time.
 
Ir 12:59
Did you lose your parents to illness or==
 
Rt 13:01
My mother died (uh) of stroke in childbirth. And my dad died of the ruptured appendicitis | which turned out to be peritonitis and (uh) killed him. They took him from here to Anchorage | and it didn&apos;t== he didn&apos;t make it | you know. (..) The doctor in Kodiak wouldn&apos;t (uh)== wouldn&apos;t even consider operating on him because he said it was too far gone for him to handle. So they took him to Kodiak or to Anchorage | and (uh) that&apos;s where he&apos;s buried. My mother’s buried in Seward. Funny thing about that one | in 1950 we were going== I was going back ‹3› Sitka on Denali | and we stopped in Seward to pick up some students. And I thought | well | I’ll walk up town | wanted a town look around | you know | and as I walked through town I just kept on following a path | and I ‹2› in a cemetery and I made maybe a few steps in the cemetery and turned. And there in front of me was my mother&apos;s grave headstone. So maybe she was calling me | you know. (..) So I said my goodbye to her then.
 
Ir 14:17
What do you remember about (uh) health care in the village with someone there who (..) you look to for daily health care needs?
 
Rt 14:30
No. Once a year the (uh) North Star would come in | that’s== via boat | with the health practitioners on board. But through the year it was just my great aunt and grandmother that took care of us and (..) I don&apos;t remember any il= the only illness I remember was (uh) mumps. I had the mumps. And this is in the summertime | that ruined my== my part of my summer. But other than that | that&apos;s all== measles | that&apos;s the only thing that I remember. I don&apos;t remem= remember being sick for== from anything else. But normal cuts and bruises were taken care of at home. No broken bones | just (uh) cuts and bruises.
 
Ir 15:16
 Do you remember (uh) midwives?
 
Rt 15:21
Midwife | my great aunt Fiona Sheretin | she was the midwife of the whole village. She delivered just about every kid that was there during that period of time | including me | myself. In fact (..) she had a son. His name is John and he had gotten killed overboard and was cut by ‹2› and that killed him. So I was a kind of a direct | indirect replacement for== for him | because when my mother was dying | she told me | go to your other mom | go to your other mama | meaning her | you know. So I would crawl over to her and be with her. So when time came for== for adoption | they opted to adopt me | you know. And then he | my great uncle | asked if I wanted to change my name to Sheretin | and I (..) opted to stay with Derenoff. I didn&apos;t know what== being that young | you know | you wouldn&apos;t think that you have had an option. But he told me I had it (..) in Russian.
 
Ir 16:24
Do you remember about how the village was governed? Who is in charge?
 
Rt 16:31
You know | I don&apos;t remember if anyone was in charge at that time. I just don&apos;t (uh) (..)== only thing I remember was (..) things were kind of governed by the church. That&apos;s all. That&apos;s all I remember. Because (..) everybody that went to church seemed to hang together | and that was the way | the life was centered around the church.
 
Ir 16:54
Do you remember if any people were particularly influential or seem= seemed to (uh) have a larger impact on others?
 
Rt 17:09
(um) Not necessarily | no. It&apos;s kind of strange | but you think that there would be somebody would have been == you think that somebody would be in charge but (..) I don&apos;t remember any one particular person being in charge except maybe Father Gerasim when he was there. It was== it was kind of the (..) == everything was centered around him | was== he was kind of the hub.
 
Ir 17:31
Do you remember any (uh) stories that you may have heard when you were younger (uh) | like (uh) little people or (uh) ‹2›.
 
Rt 17:43
(uh) The runaway? Yeah | that one is always== was a good story. They== they have a song about that | but I don&apos;t== I don&apos;t even remember the words that== I hear the== the tune every now and then | you know | like the other day | oh | Ignatius was singing that one about the runaway | that== well I remember that. And then there was another Russian ballad that was dealt with the sea called Spas’ín’i wolná | which meaning I guess (..) something== blessed sea or something like that. I think that&apos;s what== what it was. But that was a real sad song about sailors getting lost at sea. Used to hear that a lot | but I haven&apos;t heard it for so many years that if I heard the melody | I&apos;d probably remember | you know. But the words are just totally gone. And I was asking this (uh) Russian instructor we have in Sitka if he ever heard of the song | and he said he&apos;d dig back through his (uh) listings of Russian (uh) melodies and see if he can come up with it | so he&apos;s (..) supposed to let me know this fall | if he ever finds it.
 
Ir 18:51
I know that you had been gone for several years before the (uh) == the earthquake and tidal wave. I wonder if you could share about how you found out about it and what your reactions were at the time. 

Ir 23:20
Are you retired?
 
Rt 23:20
Yes | yeah. I retired in 1995. My birthday was August 5th and it happened to be on a Saturday. So Friday was the fourth and that was the day I put in my== my application for retirement and got the heck out of there. And this is in the state of Washington that I was working | and the county was (uh) Kitsap county (*Китсап – округ штата Вашингтон*) | which is on== not far from Bremerton Washington | all in the same county. And then I also worked (uh) through the operating engineers on== up on a North Slope for== during the time of the pipeline | built the== helped to build the airport in Sitka | put the bridge across the channel in Sitka. So that&apos;s | you know | been a b= busy life.
 
Ir 24:10
When was the last time you were (uh) in Afognak?
 
Rt 24:15
1953 was the last time I was there. That my last summer fishing up there | and just happened to go over there and (..) run into my cousin Harry Knagin. So there was a big dance at== at school. Harry and I went to that | dance with all the girls | and that&apos;s the last I remember of Afognak. 
 
Ir 24:41
How did it seem different going back in 1953 from when you had left in 1946?
 
Rt 24:48
 Well | the village was still laid out the same | but (uh) the people were all a little different | little older. And that&apos;s (uh)== but it was good. It was good to get back | good to see everybody. All the cousins and friends that I had (..) going around and then== and then left | you know | and still kept (..) kind of a (..) a life contact with them | for at least until 53 anyway. And after 53 I just totally dropped out of the picture because I moved in to Sitka. The ones that I would keep contact with was with the Frost family | and there&apos;s ‹3› family | that was my== all my first cousins.
 
Ir 25:29
Well can you think of any questions that I didn&apos;t ask you that you might care to share an answer to?
 
Rt 25:42
‹4›. I really can&apos;t think of any. I think you covered pretty much everything that I can remember and recall. It was sure a pleasure to see some of my (..) cousins that I never knew I had | just discovering them here recently | you know | and I== like in the last five years | I&apos;ve | you know | learned through (uh) friends how I&apos;m related to these people | you know? It was really really (..) really a revelation. It&apos;s good to know I&apos;m not alone in the world. And my== my children are(..)== all live south. My daughter lives in Portland | she has three girls.
