Because it is an island and you can't get off the island to get anywhere but they had to stay there to make sure the prisoners were cared for had food and didn't try to do away with themself or anything like that what time we are talking about What was it there this prisoner American prisoner or Russians My grandma was born at so it was a few years after that I am I am not We'll ask some questions again Okay That moves us to general picture and if I may I will ask some questions to get it clear for us so you' let's start with your mother's side of the family yeah mother's side Your mother name Nona Nona Nona Nona You spelled it like that N O N A Aha And she was her maiden name Hubley Hubley Hubley My her mother was a Chernoff who married a Hubley Aha Aha Churinoff Churnoff C H U R N O F probably It was V then americanized to every F So you know it was V at that time It is well-known family name in Alaska Chernoff Churnoff C H U or C H E E E E Chernoff Which is a very common Russian name last name And she comes from the family of Chernoff father What's her father's your grandfather Chernoff John John John Chernoff And he was Russian John Hubley Oh I am talking about my grandmother's Sorry John Hubley My grandmother And her mother was from Chernoff family Yes And Afternon Chernoff Afternon Afternon That was her name Afternon And Afternon Chernoff who was probably of Unangan origin Yes What ethnic group was she Your grandmother Afternoon Chernoff she Well Afternon is a men's name Grandfather It's a Russian men's name male name Afternon Yeah Okay So you probably didn't get it right here I didn't get right it Okay Who was John Hubley My mother's father Your mother's father he is from the other side from Nova Scotia Of what Of Nova Scotia Of Nova Scotia Uh-huh So he is Yeah Canada Canada Yes Nova Scotia Scotish people Yeah Yeah Hubley H U B L E Y And then he married a woman from Chernoff's family which is your grandmother and her name That was my question I I know it's well Afternon was your father right Hm Proskovia Proskovia Proskovia I forget about it all the time It's okay if you remember if you correct just change it Yeah And her father was Afternon That's what you said Afternon that's your great-great grandfather Yes Okay Afternon Chernoff And I ask who they They lived in Aleutian chain Yeah Unger Unger is Is an island Unger It was Afternon who worked at this Cherikoff island as a prisoner Yes And what group did he belong to What language did he speak to Afternon Russian Russian Uh-huh Okay And you know there is this other Aleut languages spoken in the Chain That's the Aleut Aleut We are Alutiiq Yeah Exactly Have it right People here call themselves Aleut too There is a confuse There is a confusion there some like my oldest daughter It was such a class of It was just a neighbors like Indians She does that too on people So you think those people were speakers of that kind o Aleut or only Russian Well they spoke Russian Aleut Alutiiq and my grandmother spoke English but it was quite broken Uh-huh So Proskovia did speak spoke some English Uh-huh they were bilingual Some English but she also spoke of course Russian because that was the language of her father and probably her mother Proskovia's mother Afternon's wife also spoke Russian though she was of Aleut origin Russian and Aleut and then Alutiiq Where did they gather Alutiiq Probably when came here I don't know when they made this separate designations They said that the Alutiiq bloodline is different from the Aleut bloodline Yeah Aaah Just like the Aleut in Japan is different from Japanese bloodline Exactly Yeah But that was long ago We are just interested about if you say Afternon Chernoff was Russian then some native American lineage would be his wife the mother of Proskovia You don't remember her name So I couldn't remember anything and then somebody asks Okay alright So that's basically your mother Nona Hubley her maiden name Chernov and they were married And what what are the years Now let's do years I am sorry if I have to may ask what year you were born Me Uh-huh I have something that may really help And when was your mother born That's easy and And do you know when your father was born John Hubley Oh I see now we have a time frame for the first part of the century And they came here to Kodiak Nuna and John did they meet here in Kodiak or somewhere else My mother and my father Julian met here in Kodiak My father is Russian Alutiiq Jewish Your father is Russian Alutiiq Jewish Interesting combination We are all some kind of mixed up Of course There is no pure blood amongst us Because you said that your John or Julian Julian I A N I got it wrong Julian Hubley he is from Nova Scotia Julian Morrison I think we are getting a little messed up here Yes So Julian Morrison Was was he your father My father was Julian Morrison My mother's father was John Hubley Hm-h so she was Nuna Hubley and then she married to Julian Morrison Excuse me I am getting tired So Julian and you said he was from Nova Scotia My mother's father Your mother's father Hm-h That's where I got it Do you have his name now John Hubley John Hubley uh-huh Hubley I had it I actually had it alright I just didn't write at that moment yet your father's name it was all correct here Now your father Julian Morrison Morrison M O R C E N R R I S O N Morrison R R I S O N So now let's talk about him He was born in And his family is from where They met in Kodiak He was born in Kodiak also Julian Yes He was born here in Kodiak but he had his family Alutiiq or Aleut Alutiiq His Was Alutiiq Her father was lord We see his picture at the museum He was a quiet man from England His mother was Kenaitze-Russian Kenaitze-Russian uh-huh I can't pronounce her name because it's about that long But I can bring you picture it's got the name on the back if you want to see Yeah So it's your mother on the father's side Yes Uh-huh Born in Kodiak His father was lord Prokopiy So I think this might help We are getting it more or less So you said your grandfather on the father's side was Lord Prokopiy Proctor Lord Proctor Oh yes It's an official title He gave up his lordship title and came to America Lord Proctor is quite a high position in Great Britain Is he British Yeah He was British English yeah Where is the picture This is your Ms Proctor uh-huh Cope And Cope was her previous name That's my grandmother's mother Father's mother's mother Here is my father's mother and that is her mother I see she was Ms V Morrison Ms Morrison And she was of what origin She is the Kenaitze Kenaitze Kenaitze-Russian Kenaitze-Russian Not Cope but she became Ms Morrison Her mother over there is Kenaitze Her father was a Chef I don't know who he is or what his name was because our oldest family information before this was packed in a large steamer in my grandfather's house And when or tidal wave came and washed everything off so we lost all Here in Kodiak So your house was affected by the tidal wave You were probably lower then now It was much lower I wasn't here at that time I was feet up practicing flying At that time you were becoming a pilot I was in Los Angeles Uh-huh Alexandra Gervalov This what it is Gervalov or Jervalov Gervalov And then Gervalov Gervalov That's her parents Her parents are Alexandra Gervalov That's her mother one half Russian and one half Kenaitze and father Simon Gerolov Russian uh-huh Simon Gerolov Russian Now this is she married this guy This is Hilarion Morrison Hilarion Morsen Morrison Morrison Yeah There is There is a history behind the name but I will confuse you with that right now And his mother was also born at Fort Ross California His mother Uh-huh And who is this person His mother Morrison's mother Morrison' So were talking about all types of Natives living married to Russian men Morrison's mother was from Fort Ross Here is the picture It is probably Fort Ross It's Fort Ross really No she was born in Fort Ross and here she is as an aged so she couldn't be in Fort Ross And when they closed Fort Ross they came here Well probably they were Alutiiq people who were taken to Fort Ross to hunt Yes That' She came to Kodiak after the plosure They came back Like there There was a Kenaitze person Peter Kalifortskiy He has this last name Kalifortskiy He was a Kenaitze-Indian but his great-grandfather was in Fort Ross and then came back So that's why he is called that way This name is familiar here There is a Kalifortskiy beach in the nearer Kenai town Oh maybe that's why I am familiar with that Yeah Was Kenaitze and her Was Kenaitze Whose mother was a daughter of the Kenaitze chief and her father was Russian Gervalov Yeah You have a very Yeah I wonder where Jewish line comes from I am Jewish so I am really interested This is my mother and her mother Her mother and your mother Your mother Nona Hubley and her I am just trying to make it right Is Proskovia Chernov Yeah No Her mother's name is Nadezhda Nadezhda Chernov I was trying to think of before that And Proskovia was someone's else name or was it the church name What do you mean Proskovia was or just came up from some other place because maybe her other name was Proskovia No She was Nadezhda uh-huh Nadezhda Chernov Her parents were Afternon Chernov and Proskovia No You asked the question where the Jewish came in My father's Mr Morrison He is not blood Morrison Eh-huh He is Shiron Shiron He is born of a Jewish father Uh-huh And coming up from San Francisco Shiron was either pushed or failed overboard Never made it back to Kodiak so this person who is called captain Morrison took the widow married her She had an older child who is illegitimate who happens to be married to the Maddison family here and raised the children by the name Morrison So that we are not true Morrisons but that's what we were raised with His step father foster Yes This is my father Julian Morrison So this is your grandfather Yes Your father Julian Morrison Right Married Jew And grandfather Morrison the one who was in to Sharot His name first name don't remember Valerian Paul Valerian Paul uh-huh Vilarian Okay So your father worked as is it a fisherman or captain Army transportation service Army transportation service So like doing the Second World War Oh yeah we had some consultants who spoke who did that in the Second World War For instance Walter Jackinsky who was also doing this people from Ninilchik Uh-huh So you were born here and you What language was spoken in the family To us children Yes English only Only So that when we went to school we wouldn't say any other words because it was not permitted like if I drop something on the floor and I just automatically say eh-ja I'll get slapped on the hand or hit on the head with a ruler Eh-ja means sorry What is it eh-ja Eh-ja just means eh-ja That's it So what were you supposed to say Not to get So you just drop a pencil just a little accident just kind of make it solid and it's typical but we were not suppose to say anything that was not English And eh-ja was not considered English No It eh-ja is either Russian or Aleut Something like auch Yeah You were supposed to say ouch Okay So but you said parents only talked English to you and what language did they speak in between themselves Russian and Alutiiq Russian and Alutiiq So they knew both Yes They were trilingual They were trilingual They was Any idea of how the Aleut differentiate between Russian and Aluttiq and in what situations they were speaking Russian and in what Alutiiq It is hard to remember Yeah When were they speaking Russian when they were speaking I wasn' I can to this day remember the phrases my grandmother would say and for the most part they were Russian but I remember from time to time some Alutiiq words and I think when they spoke they were kind of blend them together uh-huh okay And when you Just to get the point uh-huh you were growing around which grandmother Which grandmother you were growing around My mother's family they were oh three generation household Oh My father's family when my mother and father married his mother was ill and when they married they moved into my father's house my mother took care of his mother until she died and I guess about months turned there and we moved back to my mother's family But she my mother didn't quite like her father-in-law I see stern person This Valerian Paul Morrison Okay So it was Nadezhda Chernov that you were around with Yes And she spoke both Russian and Alutiiq You say that you remember certain words or phrases she was saying something like what was about it   or When somebody come in the house she say prahadíti prahadíti Somebody is leaving s bóham Say that again Somebody is leaving What would she say S bóham I am saying I am going grandma  nu s bóham Uh-huh put food on the table and she said Kúshat' kúshat' and then I can't remember I can't pull up some you know I get older my memory She is going out she say Ya gul'áu I think it's that Uh-huh And then when I went to Kalifornia the church Holy Virgin Mary Cathedral at Los Angeles the priest's wife was Russian teacher at USC so I enlisted and I took Russian for three years I was I was conversational and then I came home Nobody spoke English anymore You mean Russian Oh Russian Nobody I had no one to talk to So overtime I lost it Uh-huh Yeah Of course that's not easy language is for speaking it with someone Uh-huh So basically when you came you didn't speak Russian in your childhood you just heard it Yeah Because it was not addressed to you Exactly And neither Aleut Right Aleut neither And you studied in USC you said No No California You used to live in Southern California You studied there I did for about three years Yeah But it was later in your life Yes I was married and living down there raising my family Uh-huh Because your husband was from California No He is from Illinois actually you know the priest the Father Innocent here he is from the same place my husband came from You met in Kodiak With your husband He is dead Eh My husband is deceased Yeah I know But I mean you you met your husband here in Kodiak No In California Oh California So you went to study there and met him there Yeah Yeah And then he came over here or No They lived in California Oh you lived in California Yeah For long time Oh where You really want to know Saint Diego Saint going up Los Altos Talo Eltoe Everywhere Actually from San Diego at the very bottom to Eurika at the top where my last son was born Uh-huh and what was your husband doing What was He was a corporate attorney for Italian insurance business and they transferred Yeah Moved him around California So we saw everything in California Uh-huh but you had to change homes which is not easy Every four years Every four years Yeah Which is as soon as I get my pictures on the wall we are moving How many children do you have I have four Four sons Two girls two boys Oh you are But my second daughter was stewardess for Western airlines and this is before they were scrubbing the air the cleaning the air in the plains She contacted the viral infection lining of the heart Numinates Epicordites and she died And I brought her home for burial and Came back to This of from years and years and years back So dear family friends' separation for us Oh yeah So I only have one girl to bore a snap Mhm I see I see Did you well so you went to California to go to college When do you first went there I went down to visit my cousin Oh just to meet your When I got money and I got stuck there It wasn't too bad though California had a lot to offer schools and there was no limit if you had the ambition and to do so I did Mhm I went to school Mhm mhm Mhm school So you came already with high school like diploma from here No I had to drop out when I was fifteen years old my father was station down train down the and at that time six months to get here So we were always short of money and although stores were kind to us there was all limits I had to drop out of the school and I had to go to full time job at a hospital That helped a family pay the bills and so on so I missed a lot of my high school there Mhm But when I go to California I found out that Mhm So you went to university of Southern California M It Which university you went Uh What college When did you go to college UCLA UCLA I went to to medical school there Mhm And then you later you worked as a Yes registered nurse it's called medical assistant and I was working up to assistant Aha And I was two months away from that I wanted to get So I wanted to hurry up my husband got transferred and we had to go away Mhm And there was no such thing as course courses then or computers or anything so Mhm Too short of being a assistant Just a But you also had four children to take care That too Of course So I would clear on where Raisa's parents learned the Russian and Alutiiq I think from their families Yeah From families what locations So let's say your mother spoke Russian and Alutiiq because her mother Nadezhda Chernov spoke Russian and Alutiiq And she was from the chain She was Anga From Anga Mhm Because her father John Habley didn't speak Russian he was Anglo-American He can speak Russian he learned here I would presume so Mhm That's all he and grandma talked about back and in Russian Aha Oh they talked in Russian your grandmother and grandfather Mhm Because your grandmother you said Nadezhda Chernova she she spoke English did she or She spoke English but it was broken Aha aha Mhm Just enough to make us Mhm Understand her As for her mother who is did she know any English I didn't know her You didn't know her super well and So talking about Nadezhda and John did they meet here in Kodiak or they met somewhere in in Anga Here Here Ok Here Ok mhm Aha so your your mother grew up here in Kodiak mhm Mhm Ok we don't know but we may expect that she didn't know much English because her yeah That far away anyway Yes Far away and we but already know that her father was Russian Avtonom Chernov who served at Chirikof Island as prison guard so that's where her Russian comes from proudly her mother we don't know who Proskovya's mother was but proudly she was Aleut from Anga Russian Yeah So she might be also speak in Russian And Julian was also born in Kodiak yeah Yeah Her father Julian Morison was born in Kodiak in Yeah From Valeriya and Paul Morison who in fact was as we know and also your grandmother who oop I I don't have her name but she was herself your grandmother what's her name was the one who Valeriya and Paul married Oh Susan Susan Yeah We didn't get that's name Susan Cope Susan Cope Yes Susan Cope I wonder where she get this last name Cope Oh that came from her father Because then we have lexandra That's her parents That's her parents Alexandra and Semyon And they are Kenaitze No So she was Kenaitze No Semyon Gervalov is Russian Semyon Gervalov is Russian Ok Her mother lexandra Hazel Cope half Kenaitze Yeah Yeah lexandr Cope And my father's mother Susan Cope Mhm question Aha ok Susan Cope was a daughter of someone whose last name was Cope Proctor Cope Proctor Cope Mhm Proctor Cope and he his wife was daughter of lexandr and Semyon Gervalov that's what I understand who don't know her name What is it that you don' you don't know We don't know the name of the wife of Doctor Cope because that woman was daughter of lexandra and Semyon Gervalov or was she lexandra's Yeah But that is that a Susan No Susan was Cope she couldn't be Gervalov otherwise she would be Gervalov she was Cope Ok Let's go back here Julian his mother is Susan Yes Susan Cope married to Valeriya Morison but she was Susan Cope if she was Cope her father was Cope Proctor Cope Her mother talking about her mother that's the only one we don't Is is this Susan that's Proctor Cope's wife Yes Mrs Proctor Cope this this is but we don't know her first name Do we Is that on the backside her parents I think these are her parents right Mhm Which is from Kenai half Russian half Kenaitze and her father Semyon Gervalov Russian So Alexandr Gervalov you said half Kenaitze was coming from chief her father was a chief Yeah Her father was a chief So so we don't the her name this woman but this woman was married to Valeria Paul Morison Ok So Alexandra and Semyon Gervalov had a daughter this woman who married Proctor Cope and they had a daughter Susan Cope right And Susan Cope married Valeria and Paul Morison So what is wrong we only don't know this the the first name of this lady very impressive lady on that picture Which one this one we don't know her first name It's Alexandra It's Alexandra Yeah Ah ah so it's not her mother it's her She was Gervalov by her father Gervalov but then who was Cope A man she married Ok Ok alright So she married Proctor Then ok Susan Gervalov became Susan Cope Great I think you need to draw in the picture draw in the picture that is make it because we have Susan and we have and it' it' it's complicated So let's start from your father Julian Morison Morison we won't go into other details about his mother Susan Cope Susan Cope from Mhm And she was married to Paul Valeria The other way Valeria and Paul Morison Ok * - * So then Susan Cope was the daughter of lexandra and Semyon Gervalov fine Gervalov Let me check No There was Proctor Cope Someone Susan Cope Susan Cope Her father Proctor Cope Yeah Proctor Cope Let's take her father Lord Proctor It's a good picture so we Proctor Cope so and her mother Susan's mother was lexandra and lexandra so lexandra now would only would going by female side of the family and lexandra was a daughter of Semyon Gervalov Mhm An interesting name Gervalov this is not very common Russian name I mean it's Russian but I don't know many Gervalovs maybe he was maybe it was just mixed Pronunciation and something changed over the years Yes maybe Aha and her mother was this Kenaitze woman Yeah Mhm Mhm We don't know whether she was full Kenaitze woman of half Russian we don't know Well over there on a they pretty much to themselves Aha mhm mhm Quite on here and the emulsions around us archipelago the there are so many blends Yeah Mhm Even early on M-hmm From the main land they were broke down So the Kenaitze Indians didn't mix so much no They were very warlike Mhm warlike Very Mhm they killed one of the region missionaries Yeah Oh yeah That was Kenaitze who did right Yeah I just start to wonder if my grandfather added anything to do Well you don't have to worry about it No it was an it was on Kenai but near Iliamna Yes On the other Mhm Exactly So don't worry Yeah There were people So doesn't seem there is any Alutiiq ancestry here You say that your parents knew Alutiiq to each other it probably learned it from you know their neighbours and communicated It's interesting Yeah Because not much Alutiiq There is Aleut but that's different as it all I know I was too young to understand or even care about what was going on Aha To myself Mhm Just grew up a typical child Mhm And dominant Russian we were raised in Russian tradition Mhm That's my grandmother was Nadya Mhm yeah Where Nadezhda Chernova Yeah Did he call her And everything was then according to Russian custom Mhm Church was the foundation of the family life Mhm And and And was there bringing strict or milder What do you mean How did did they raise children was it strict or more mild Well I can't speak for other families but our family are houseful was a happy one Papa was the my grandfather and papa played the Stradivarius Mhm Aha Violin and he took all of his children to play Aha They never had formal lessons but they all played instruments Aha I have a picture of one of my uncle he is he's bought six or seven instruments In front of them he played every one of them Mhm And when the fishing was done they didn't fish year around like they do now all day long all day long Mhm It was very happy household Mhm So they knew how to work and how to have fun Mhm my father's strict and kinda cold Mhm Da Usually they don't say it about Jewish what household maybe about British maybe there was more of this English maybe it was of his family How he was how they wrotes him because if you say he was a low boy But then when my mother and father married in our household when we finally had our own household was a happy one Mhm My father big on practical jobs and he played the guitar so we have music Mhm It was happy Mhm Mhm I kind of a sad excuse me Sure Alutiiq - - John Habler - broken English - - You know we were talking about between ourselves how Russian was here if for instance your grandfather John Habley spoke better spoke better in Russian than your grandmother Nadezhda Chernova spoke English that's you said they were communicating in Russian Mhm Which meant that Russian was better Very strong Right that' that's why I say we were raised in Russian household Yes And who is Is it Chernov Oh which one Avtonom Avtonom Avtonom Chernov oh well mother grandmother your mother grandmother your great grandmother it's great grandfather great great grandfather ah and his wife from Anga She's also probably not completely Aleut there she probably had Russian father as well Mhm Mhm Yeah Yeah You have your family history you know it well Yeah So of the church because of the approximating everything they made sure we knew who we were within degrees so we would marry Mhm Within degree he wouldn't allowed Mhm So we have to know who we were Then this side John and Nadezhda Habley on their th wedding anniversary or father for us came to Mhm Was John also Yes So he converted to Russian church Where he's born He was Mhm So in Nova Scotia he was from Nova Scotia His father his father his father was from Nova Scotia but he was already born here Yeah Also he probably also had Russian mother but Russian or local mother Ok So because we don' Susan John himself who was from Nova Scotia but his No Yeah Yeah His Yeah Yeah Aaa That's you see I already crossed it because we can not get all the lines here we'd only spoke to John Habley than kind of left this line ok But we understand that now we understand that your grandfather John Habley was also from British father Some kind of Russian speaking mother Russian speaking mother Scottish If Habley was Scottish yes not British Mhm but not English and some Russian speaking mother and Nadezhda mhm and also well yeah Ok Now I have still one question here You see what happened on the Habley side Ithec Habley was a waver came to the chains on a shipwreck there Mhm Ithec is John's father And Yes I will write it in here Yeah Mhm And waiting for another ship to take the boat years to come back road so that they could get back home Meanwhile Ithec saw this little Russian native girl fell in love got married forgot about way home And stayed So that's how we to to the line I see Then we only missed one chain Ithec Habley as I understand because we already got Russian picture of Avtonom Chernov and his his wife from Anga and they had daughter Praskovya Your great grandmother but who she was married we don' we just delegate it left it because you don' I have all of this graft out some place Ok Aha What I had the house remodel Mhm Mhm And I can't find anything Yeah Don't worry Don't worry but what was he maybe you may know your grandmother Nadezhda was born here in Kodiak Chirikov Island Chirikov Chirikov oh She on her Chirikov is next Ok Close to Sitka I think Yeah Chirikov where is it It's island of shore west of year and a bit more Ok Ok Near KodiakOk Yeah Then we get something confused you you said that Nadezhda Chernov's father was Avtonom then we I don't know who is probably should just we got a-a-an extra chain yeah that' Yeah That was a yeah you have straight because because it was a first guest for the grandmother's name and Yes Yes Exactly Avtonom Chernov oh maybe was the name of Avtonom's wife who knows Ok Ok Whatever And they yes of course she was Then Nadezhda was born at Chirikov and she she came here mhm and her you didn't know your grandfather Thank you Chernov no I didn't Thank you She got pretty strong So yeah It's good Very good some it's earl gre Yeah Yeah Yeah mhm Very good That's honey friendly Sugar That was sugar Yeah Mhm thank you And what is this is it wings or something chicken It's chicken ah And talking about the school you mentioned that they didn't let you speak anything but English Right And it was the teachers No This will showed in Jackson this was after Alaska was sold to America Mhm yeah They sent I don't know who the sitting president at that time was but they sent just Sheldon Jackson who is minister up here Mhm Was the intent to civilize Mhm Mhm And there is not much set about what he thought but we were into five different sections Mhm Catholic Mapjust Moravian Perspecterian Mhm mhm the other one and this was bad this country Mhm method's maybe no Oh yes That' Mhm So they said about trying to kill everything change the language dress everybody in Mhm I grew up under that So what kind of school was it Was it public school or BIA school Territorial Territorial Mhm Yes So kind of BIA Mhm Which is Mhm made of school But the teachers were from Washington DC Mhm And this is when we got lucky We have good teachers they were humane And in some they were strict because the boys Misbehaved yeah Behaving problems Mhm But I enjoyed school I just loved loved loved it Mhm And I was good student and they furnished everything but teachers taught basics none of this social what we have nowadays in school everything was ABCs Mhm Mhm We are comeconomic class then the boys are the shop class Mhm that's cold close the door no I'm just watching the cat Oh The cat Yeah There is a cat there Mhm the school was very good here And thinking how wonderful education we got just on basics no fancy school plain building those multimillion dollar school of walls glass Mhm Mhm It Mhm And can you remember any more Russian expressions that you heard in your childhood I've got that you didn't ask me Doing something for Sparry Oh for Sparry Why Would he teach you Russian He wants me to write down when I think of words growing up Oh yeah To write them down because she wants to make a little directory or catalog or something Chulán Oh you remember that word Oh yeah Used I I used it Where is Where is your There So it will be closet in Yeah Great Kal'idór Yeah Chúchila What is That's a rock pile or a memorial Up on top the hill from the beginning of time it was a custom during the summer for families to climb the hill and take a rock and then put the rock on top to a pile and the pile was huge huge huge huge over the years it grew and then during the War when military came they all were knocked down Because it' there there American Army was very destructive Really I just want to try something actually I'm not very hungry Down the chain they looted the churches took icons used churches for garages And one village was totally destroyed they wouldn't allow people to go back to return after war So yeah so interesting but it was where would they start this pile Some memorial place as a memory of some person Letterine as my grandma told me that there were two boys who were in love with the same girl She couldn't make up her mind which one she wanted so I guess their feeling between them got so intense they went on top of the hill way up on top to fight it out and they fought until they killed each other and they didn't come back And she went up to see what happened to them and when she saw that they were dead and she died from a broken heart right there with them That's why the memorial was built for them It's a legend Not build but brought made by these rocks that people would bring Yes by rock by rock That's a legend That was So what is next While I'm getting the treat Gaspazhá and gaspad'ín that we don't use anymore The first before you said what Gaspazhá Mr and Mrs These are forms of address Uh-huh Formal Yes we use it in Russia again Oh you do Was it used in your childhood In addressing other people For us children to address the adults Chernov Gaspadín and gaspazhá With a last name or just by itself With a last name Right Gaspad'ín I think it's the wife is just master It's like with sir and ma'am Oh okay It's like Mr and Mrs Yeah initially Kr'ísa How do you say Kr'ísa I have a cousin we called her kr'ísa Is it the derogatory Well she was a mouse She was shy Oh shy Yeah And we had one person at church is a but he thinks he is so important so important that one evening I came in to church for I was first one there old habit from being a starosta for thirty-five years still go early And coming in the door and he came up rushing out to me You can't come in you can't come in' What's wrong What's happening' We're very intense meeting' You're having a meeting and there's always the rectory and there's always a basement you don't have meetings in the church' So he tried to hold me back coming to church So from then I always call him kr'ísa So it means that actually you don't like him very much Correct You are correct Sabáka Kóshka Now there is a word here that nobody has been able to interpret Maybe you know Tagúra Is it an animal We don't know Can you remember any context situation when you would use it Yes It sounds to me like Japanese It's that area just beyond that seminary the whole area that's used to be called tagúra Did Japanese live there There was Volkov family one person that was Volkov land That's what Bill told us yeah One person in Volkov family married a Japanese named Yushida and there were two boys George and Ivo Ushida I grew up with both of them So I wondered maybe they brought because of they brought that name tagúra Excuse me the kettle is boiling Do you remember this phrase Does it make sense You know what it means I know the word The tea is boiling Oh Cháshku cháyu How did you say Cháshku cháyu And if these words are not the words that you learnt while studying Russian with These were common everyday words we use here Yes yes That's what Sparry wanted Of course Did you have I gave to my son Oh no I mean you know in your childhood Did you use one or
