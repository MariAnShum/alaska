not people from Kodiak from No No it University of Fairbanks Yeah Mhm So they who's interested in In tsunami Yeah In Earthquakes But then we there we went beyond that to our lifestyle Yeah mhm It's a very valuable information So they made some recording I will definitely share comment when I'm back Yes sure inquire about it You started talking about Russian Oh yes Could speak Russian from Afognak So you spent less time in Afognak that Helen right Helen was born and raised there Mhm See I was I was in a I was born and we spoke Alutiiq but as my parents passed away I was pretty in a Russian-speaking home Mhm mhm So your parents passed away and you went to some other family Aha So And they were Russian-speaking Okay but initially your parents were Aleut-speaking Mhm So they lived I know that there were two parts in this village Aleut town D'ir'éwn'a Mhm So your parents initially they lived in which part Aleut town Aleut town Aleut town So and were there like that most people in Aleut town were Aleut speakers They no they spoke English Yes sure There were a lof of English there but the elderlies spoke their native Russian or Alutiiq Okay And did they speak Russian to Yeah I Yeah I just taught him It's kind but their main language mostly spoke English I suppose yeah Mhm But if we take these two languages Aleut and Russian And Russian So for them their main language was Alutiiq and they knew some Russian I Is it right yeah I can't answer that honestly Okay and how old were you when your parents passed away I was four when mum passed away and seven when my dad passed away so And you moved to Derevnia after that well yeah I moved from the Aleut town to D'ir'éwn'a It's beyond the Russian Orthodox church Mhm And so that other family was Russian-speakers Mhm So did they speak They spoke Russian the man of the family spoke both Russian and Alutiiq Mhm But today now you go the dictionaries that they have of Alutiiq language and I've attended spme of the classes and camp Many of the word are borrowed from Russian in that dictionary that I the Russian words I can recognize them In Alutiiq Aha in Alutiiq dictionary but they' they right out at Russian words that are Alutiiq's borrowed I should've brought a dictionary with me Mhm mhm And so you' you're sisters right Sisters-in-law In law Sisters-in-law Aha aha so you were raised in Afognak so you moved when you were four to other From Aleut town to D'ir'éwn'a And what was the name of your parents that other family what is their last name and first name Chichenoff Selma and Alek Chichenoff Alexei Mhm That' that's your parents No My parents were Nadya and Robert Knagin Mhm So Alexei Knagin is your relative He's my he's my nephew Oh Because I met him in Kodiak and had a nice talk with him and the other pair who lived in Kodiak Sally Chichenoff He's a good one to talk to Have you talked to him Many times He was very nice He didn't mind talking He was so active and you Yeah It it was his folks that brought me up actually Sally Chichenoff's Mhm mhm mhm So he is sort of your brother or Mhm Yeah interesting and by the way he mentioned many times that they should go to both of you and you know to speak about because yeah he mentioned your names mhm I I have your names in my notebook in Kodiak Wow and so so and they used to speak Russian in their everyday life mhm The Chichenoffs Selma and Alexander mhm Yeah mhm so just you know they spoke to each other And when the kids when the kids were in the house and they didn't want us to you know in their conversation they'd say Stuṕyi na úl'itsu igŕt' And you know what I said You all start to cry Aha aha Yeah Good so yeah Ya hochú ja hochú speak to Russian Yeah Ya hochú sl'íshat' Good so your Russian sounds very good They taught me in Anchorage One of our housekeepers for my daughter she was a Russian she's told me that I speak it almost like they do but and then I was told that if I were to Russia then I wouldn't be able to understand now It's you know maybe 'Cause it's changed It has changed yeah but maybe it's the first stage later you will you will be adjusted to you know Mhm Like you know my English is very bad and when I come to the States during the first day I can hardly understand anything but maybe in the course of time in two weeks I start speaking You're doing very well I do my best But I think that we can switch to Russian now You know and then we went to the school there was I can't remember the priest's name but he held classes for kids that wanted to go after school Mhm So after regular school And all I could remember from there was Posad'íl d'ed r'é̤pku T'án'it pat'án'it i w'ítash'it' n'i móget Right Remember that Yes it's children's rhyme of fairytale aha fairytale I've seen that in one of the bookstores in Anchorage I'd wanna get it so I could remember the rest of it these two parents Aha These two used this same fairytale aha aha To read it for kids Oh yes Even to you Mhm aha What is her name I have a book by So And I love to read it because when was that you learned Russian You had Russian class at school or so After school we'd go to the church the Russian Orthodox Church parsonage we'd go to their house and then have lessons Mhm what time was that And It was probably about - o'clock and we started off with the alphabet like   and then De Ge De E Zhe Ze And who taught you Russian I can't remember the name of the priest it was one of the priests Mhm Mhm What It wasn' it wasn't Johny Nabners' grandpa No no I he wouldn't even around even around here now Sorry I'm old but not that old Bettie Ya ya safs'ém st́raya b́ba Your I told him I'm a very old woman Your Russian is just wonderful Spas'íbo Yeah This Patrihia mhm mhm Polaco mhm I like her books It' it's Russian Yeah Because the the names in there you know they all names that were yeah Mhm It There are even Russian place names here Yeah Pavlovo Babushka's book yeah Yeah there's some Russian characters I guess I know most of them From my childhood I bet you do Abner Katór'iy d'én' s'evódn'i Thank you Ftórn'ika ya dúmayu So Abner is also a Russian speaker Yeah You speak Russian - Well yeah Dóbr'iy mhm You still his yeah and his grandfather talked Russian to Russian priest you showed me the photo of him Yeah yeah So he was Russian that priest yeah His grandfather was Russian by origin No I don't think so He he was born here Mhm mhm In Alaska But how did he know Russian Why I'm not really sure It was probably the early Russian influence but even at at that time Mhm What was his name Petyalin Alexander Mhm mhm Petyalin So a Russian last name Mhm In Afognak growing up we had no movie theater we didn't have Any entertainments Any entertainments like the big so everything kinda revolved around the church you know and so we were busy though keeping our days and then birthdays half Russian and half English you know but when Abner said when he was first in school they were punished for speaking Russian Mhm You know when the English-speaking Let's say with Alutiiq they would the language When when was that what years It's And that's the or in he was born Mhm And so you know the really nineteen hundred Mhm mhm He said that one time that the teacher was asking what is the plural for pigs And or what was yeah He said he was just a little guy sw'in'yá and the teacher smacked his hand and made him stand in the corner because Oh my god He used it you know he used a Russian word So they were punished who Mhm mhm So children spoke in the home you know and I guess when they were out together but they didn't speak it at school But they were allowed to speak it in their home Nobody was controlling No No They had their privacy area Yeah But I was very much surprised to learn that there was somebody who taught you Russian after school Mhm In the church So it was forbidden It wasn't forbidden Oh really And at school you couldn't speak And at the school ground the school ground or in the building Because it was a Russian person teaching Russian when the English teachers came from the States Mhm From the United States because Alaska was not a state then It was a territory yeah yeah So so they weren't allowed I think maybe the teachers something it I guess it was that way they a lot of people have told me that in the States that if you spoke Spanish you had to speak English you know and if you spoke some you know our country is such a melting pot of different nationalities that is was Right right That it was ish and Swedish and German and you weren't allowed to speak your own language And I noticed excuse me I noticed that there are many Scandinavian names you know in Alaska Oh yes So Swedish and Norwegian and Swedish Yes So there were many people from those countries in all these villages all All yes All over Kodiak And they married native women Mhm And they were also in Afognak like Scandinavian Oh yes yes German too Italian Yes even Italian oh Mhm twenty So they these Scandinavian speakers who married native women they hardly spoke Russian I think no I haven't heard any of them speak Russian they might've picked it up But they mostly spoke English of course Mhm English And they never learned Alutiiq or Russian yeah I can't answer this question honestly Okay okay Yeah they what I was gonna say Oh it you know if there was a Norwegian person who married a Alutiiq spouse one couldn't understand the other so it wasn't spoken you know it was kind of Sign language yeah but I guess most people in your days already could speak English Oh yes aha So they could speak English Yeah At least some English mhm but so in Russian families I mean in those families that resided in Derevnia part was there any some knowledge of Alutiiq in those families Mhm mhm Oh yes So it was kind It was kind They were bilingual Really 'cause they talked Russian English and Alutiiq Yes And then some of them maybe the Scandinavian so And by the way I've got a question with this word Alutiiq Is it a new word or was it used in your days when you lived in Afognak say Did people you know call this language Alutiiq No Aleut Aleut is all I've heard Aleut yeah yeah yeah Aleut mhm mhm Yes yes this a new Yeah that' that's yeah that's what I also suspect But I It's okay honey Mhm And I also heard the name Sugpiaq but it's kind it's also a new one Oh that' It's something yeah But so I had a hard time with that so I don't know Yeah yeah So mostly people said that it was Aleut right Or in those days I mean Mhm Native language yeah Mhm And you know one more question you know I'm trying to figure out how it worked all these names for languages and for people and in many books you know I've heard about creols Yeah actually could you maybe explain to me what kind of did you use this word first of all That' In your childhood when you were younger and stayed in Afognak Did people use the word creol They did I was called a kr'eólka and in a slang you know and then I thought well I didn't know what it was so I It was when when half the family was white and half the family was Russian Mhm mhm Right because some non-Russian and Russian Mhm mhm mhm I know that' they called us too in the schools if you were not full Aleut or full Russian then you were creol I where did I just read that Actually I have that written down on my boots My brother he's Aleut you know Really So that's a piece of history So your brother's birth certificate there Aleut Aleut Aleut yeah it's written Aleut and in It's creol Creol wow See it depended on on the midwives Oh aha And the midwife that delivered me she didn't know how to write because her name was written with in mark with an X Oh oh oh So I've got a piece of history in my Yeah Yeah that's wonderful Sounds very interesting Aha Oh excuse me No no no And some of the babies their birth dates were not on the same day they were born They they were recorded when they were baptized Right Some of them Mhm Baptismal day was instead of birthday Mhm mhm And so you know there some my sister had two birthdates And for the longest time she went by the earlier birthday When she applied her her birth certificate said that she So she got a different birthday for other document yeah Yeah Interesting And with names I noticed that all actually in Afognak I guess all the people were Orthodox right Most of Most of them yeah And all Orthodox people have sort of two names One is American Yes And one is Russian name Mhm yeah It's also connected somehow tied up with the church With the church baptismal day my Russian name like my name is Helen in English and in Russian Elena Mhm mhm So and they will give my sister Barbara was Barbara so Varvara And we'd say Warwara and that's not right because proper the V instead of the W We use W in Russian quite a bit Mhm Yeah interesting And aha so it's how how are these Russian names given In what they take it from the book I know from an elder that they named say well you had a relative of mostly like that Like there was a lot of Mariyas and and then if they liked somebody it was Mariya aha So it's just some deceased relative right Or even a living one you know because I know someone that had been named the Russian given name after living person Did you you got your name after somebody Elena my one of my grandmothers I don't know about mine It's Evgenia Mhm It's exactly like my name by the way Oh really Yeah because actually I always introduced myself as Eugene because you know no one can pronounce the Russian name So the your Russian name Evgeniy Evgeniy It Evgeniy So that is the Eugene is kind of the the So that is the male gender Well yeah yeah And Evgenia is We use we use this name both for men and women it's no problem Oh really Oh Evgeniy And he' Man's name Evgenia would be woman's name Aha Yeah Evgenia So it' yeah And if it's Alexander name Aha Alexander is Russian Orthodox name Mhm mhm So interesting So it's it's not that the name was taken from the church book you know there is character no it's just to honor somebody's memory yeah Mhm But they've really kept wonderful book though in the Russian Orthodox The weddings and baptismals and births Because when I worked at the Senior Citizens if I needed a birth certificate I'd have to go to the Russian Orthodox he's gone now He would translate it from there Everything was in Russian in their books And he'd translate a copy for me in English Mhm and the state of Alaska and any other they honored the the Church records you know so during when they started A lot of a lot of older folks did not have a birth certificate So the priest could they would take it from the records of the church And were these all Russian traditions and actually in Afognak of course I'm pretty sure that you followed all these Russian traditions and Russian calendar like an they have a two-week difference with They celebrated both Both The Russian and English American So Christmas it's kind of you know it's later Yeah January yeah And so is Easter sometimes two weeks Months sometimes Months yeah Yeah It's always different But those were very important you know dates holidays Christmas and Easter Are these two observed today I mean all these Orthodox traditions or you know prazniks They still have it They still celebrate Easter the Russian Orthodox They used Starring which I heard that they don't do it anymore in Russia They go from house to house with their star and maybe in some places in Russia they do Hardly And they they sing their Carols in Russian Mnógaya l'éta So do you do people still do that right now They still do that Oh They still practice it today No more in Russia they don't sing Carols and they don't go for Starring and Easter is a very big holiday that's very holy Everybody celebrates it It's the you see maybe in today's Russia it's even more important that Christmas Yes that is with us too Even you know the our church a little chapel Easter is the biggest and most important because Christ dies and rose again Yeah yeah And so what do you do for Easter What what traditions are still kept today They have what is called a holy week at the Orthodox church And they they have a seven- they still practice seven weeks of lent And they're not as strict or devout I don't know what word to use on that now with their fasting but some of them fast really on the last week And then there's lot of last week the seventh week of lent And then they have their good variety What is the Russian word for lent Ya n'i znáyu Mhm mhm Could it be no Okay it' ít's the modern word What' The Great Lent is called Oh W'el'ík'iy post Páska We celebrate Páska Yeah And and do for Easter do you make Kul'ích yeah Oh yes As a matter of fact in my place yesterday Oh I too I did too I got it ready for I was going to yeah And eggs do you Colour eggs Yeah mhm mhm Colour eggs It's and what would be the Russian expression for colour eggs Eggs would be Yáytsi Yeah Krásn'iye yáytsi Ya n'i znáyu kak skazát' It's exactly what you wonderful So Easter is still the biggest holiday And in connection with so Starring is one important thing It' it's still observed It's still observed Yeah mhm great And not only among older people but also young people They have a younger generation that keeping Yeah Good And there is another sort of tradition which is not observed anymore in Russia but it was observed in the past Like Masquerading Oh Is I didn't see it last couple years here But they they were practicing it here when I first moved over here Mhm And that was That was a big thing in Afognak In Afognak Oh Tell me how it worked how was it observed What did you do what was the point Well they dressed up in and they for how many days A week yeah Was there a Yes from after Russian Christmas Tenth To the nineteenth So many days Yeah or to the fourteenth and then nineteenth was a holiday Kr'ishchén'a Oh Right exactly Ya n'i zabúla Is back I'll be right back Mhm Would you like more coffee No thank you thank you Okay And so what was the point People change their dress put on what costume Oh yes And they were nice They were nice costumes They weren't like today's So you were getting ready You were preparing them in advance On that day they would have dance They would dance you know They were dancers It was kind of costumes It was kind of you know it's up to you to prepare Yeah aha I remember before this they used to have these really nice screen masks with the face that had your nose and then your eyes And then they'd wear a cloak underneath that and then have room for their breathing and stuff And and they went from house to house and then they'd have a dance 'cause we were allowed to go to dances the parents take the children there and we'd sit aside on benches watching the masqueraders Mhm But you yourself did not participate You' No as we grew older we did Older Aha But I've never have gotten into it that much Yeah Did you get any gifts small coming from house to house what You know on Masquerading I don' I don't remember No oh well Remember mister Petyalin used to give out oranges apples soda pop Is that during the Masquerading time sometimes I'm not I know on Christmas time they did Maybe Mhm On Christmas Yeah maybe it was And then the one that was a star bearer Whoever owned the star they'd slip 'em you know they didn't have too much money then they'd give them whether it'd be a dollar or five dollars Just appreciation Mhm mhm And so during this Masquerading it was kind of you know sort of a team of people Different groups Different groups Aha There were several groups And they visited from house to house Mhm So and you were under disguise People couldn't recognize you Aha yeah And then we tried to guess them try to find out who it is Mhm mhm So that's wonderful So did you turn turned your clothes you know the other side no It's you have a special cause Yeah Aha Prepare Mhm yeah that's fantastic because we do not observe it anymore No no it' it' it hasn't I haven't noticed it here last couple years so I don't know if they still I haven't seen or heard anything either but in Kodiak they have Fourteenth Fourteenth They have a big masquerade Ball Ball and and so that' that' Where does it take place It's Ex-club Ex-club And they have prizes for the best dress for So nice Most humorous and stuff like that Most humorous and stuff like that What I used to like was I remember when they go for Starring Carol is the that's Rad'íls'a nam spas'ít'el fs'emú m'íru iskup'ít'el (*  *) And it tells the whole of Salvation right there in one song And I remember that Mhm Mhm mhm Do you remember some greetings on all these occasions like on Christmas did people sort of congratulate each other Greet Yeah Each other in some special way And actually what is for Christmas This is s prázn'ikam Yeah S prázn'ikam s prázn'ikam Yeah and Easter was Kr' Kr'istós vaskr'es Kr'istós vaskr'es and then Woíst'inu vaskr'és aha aha In response Good and so did you use to kiss each other some did I used to dakuran'itsa some and some would do with a from this cheek Mhm Three times Aha So that's all tradition and did they kiss the Aha Oh Yeah yeah that's how they do it today too Yeah that's wonderful So that'   that's Greeting for a holiday For any holiday yeah Mhm Mhm Good And so and was there a Russian word for Masquerading Just Maskarád'i Aha maskarád'i Good good good And just I have so many questions I don't know which one to pick And in church in church all services in church were in in Russian They used to be in Slavonic Slavonic And Russian you know Now they're doing a lot of the switches they're doing a lot of the services in English now Mhm mhm And I believe that's why they're getting more of people going back Mhm mhm So and how many people do go to to church today to services I don't know 'cause I belong to the chapel right here Mhm mhm So to this When I when I'm invited to the services there I go because you know they respect us When we invite them they come so I go Especially to the Easter service And You mean to other Orthodox church Aha aha Yeah we attend all the funerals weddings Are there any special Weddings yeah Are there any special features you know the wedding services or wedding parties Some Russian stuff Yeah With the crowns and they go the crowns they use crowns They don't use that in Russia anymore that I know Crowns The crowns unless they just put them over the heads now Before they'd hold them over and just set the crowns on the person's head Unless you can tell me different They hold crowns They still hold Okay And by the way I was at the wedding service in Kodiak in Russian Orthodox church When I was in Kodiak right Did they set the crown on And you know all the people who were present at that wedding service they criticized the priest because they hold of flowers above the heads of the Oh they wouldn't have a crown what's that Yeah Where are the crowns Do they kind The crowning is because I I have a pamphlet with meaning of the Orthodox why they go around and why they have the candles and why they become one Mhm It's interesting And in old days I guess that speaking about meals for example Many I think there were many Russian dishes used in Afognak right These were cooked And are they still kept P'irók I don't know You know up to these days up to the present Do the people still cook some some of it So it' it's  you said yeah Mhm Are you familiar with that Absolutely I really really P'irashk'í Weh ave it even in Russia today We have a lot of like you know sort of fast food Aha yeah It says  or  And there are sort of booze or something Oh yes You can buy or cafés sort of nets cafés We have McDonalds we also have But besides McDonalds we have these big nets like you know   They're very popular because they're nice and you know nice fillings like fish Oh yes Meat or cabbage or mushrooms or There's one place in Washington I used to like to go and order one of those p'irashk'í and borsh that soup Mhm mhm The beet soup yeah And what dishes so did you cook specifically Russian dishes Chay Which you cooked in Afognak and which are still kept up to the present day It's and how did you cook it Kind of because you Different Yeah Charlie stop that He's for service crust on the bottom Aha aha And then filling with the rice and the vegetables and the fish and then top it off that's how I do mine And I use carrots rutabaga cabbage onions Mhm What would be the Russian words for all this stuff And then salmon yes Sometimes the R'íba patóm corned beef ya n'i znáyu kak skazát' Corned beef I'm afraid it' it's just meat Aha Oh aha Myása Aha This is it's canned corn beef yeah Was there special Russian word for canned Bánk'i Mhm Aha Bánk'i or bánashnay is it possible to say so Yeah Mhm like canned meat Is it the Yeah myása myása aha Mhm mhm good Now you say it the way you said it first m'ása Okay That' that's the real Russian modern Russian pronunciation Aha But maybe you say differently No no It' yeah that's how you say it today R'íba yáytsi kartóf'il'I másla sáhar Malakó Is Ya n'i znáuy Maybe the word carrots Carrots Carrots Could it be No okay No no problem it' What's a répka Rutabaga Rutabaga Oh yeah So you also use rutabagas Aha Looks so sounds so good And so was one of these typical Russian dishes dish And what but was it cooked on special occasions not for every day 'cause it's kind Mostly special occasions But family get-togethers Gatherings Yeah And then when they didn't have the fresh salmon they used a salt salmon for p'irók Oh really Yeah What would be Russian for salt salmon Ya n'i znáyu Sal'ónay aha Yes Yeah sal'ónay So yeah very good And so What other what other dishes were there besides So something else and Little pies You mentioned Yeah the small The small ones Mhm And they'd they don't do it like you know some of them they'd put in the water but some are just baked in the oven Yeah Mhm mhm mhm And it's smaller but they with the filling Aha Also same kind of filling like fish Yes I'd cheat and make a Mexican one once in a while And that's good I made a Mexican p'irók That was really good Cultural mix Spanish rice in your filling Oh Yeah Yeah So they and maybe any And tarts Mhm mhm Tarts okay Tárachk'i You how did it go Tárachk'i Oh oh oh that's how do they because I've never I didn't get this word before So that sounds really interesting So what are they They're little puff crust or else pie crust And the bottom is hole you cut them with I mean cutter cutter And then you make a little hole on the top like a doughnut But then on top And fill that with salmonberry or whatever Mhm Jelly Then there was Russian teacakes Russian teacakes I don't know if there was Yeah they're called Mexican wedding cakes They have several names I don't know if those were actually Russian But I did that when father Gerasim a priest he came to Afognak when he was very young and I really liked him It' he and I've made after Johny and I got married Is is it the person who's buried in It's his tomb Aha yeah Mhm mhm He made a dessert with bread douth he lined a pan with bread and then with cooked dried apples He'd put a layer of that another layer of dough and back and forth It took several so inside the dough wouldn't be raw you know to bake But that was really good Mhm mhm Interesting And you mentioned Russian some Russian teacakes what was that Russian teacakes They're little Buttery Yeah You just roll them up into little balls And then you roll them in some egg-white and nuts walnuts bake them Powder or after they're while they still powdered sugar And did you bake these small cakes like Maybe there's Russian word in modern Russian maybe you didn't use it in old days Oh yeah Yes Is that Russian and Polish both Oh it's Russian Okay It's Russian yeah It' it's sort of Nothing no jam and just no No Just you Oh Kind of it' yeah it's just kind of ornamental like twisted Mhm sometimes alád'iks Oh Yeah So and They are still used today Oh yes aha With all this baking like you know and these Russian teacakes do people They still do Bake them today Yeah Oh yes And these small or Alád'iks they' you can make them any size Different people make them different sizes And then fry them in you know hard oil Good And yeah Yes Yeah These these considered to be those to have sort of net like you know fast food And and they make different fillings They wrap you know so either meat or I don't know fish or mushrooms or whatever inside the big pancake That' 'Cause I Instead of hamburger I still I they call them crepes today in English Oh oh oh And you know I still make them every Christmas morning for my family bl'in'í Good good good When when I was growing up they used to mostly add just butter and syrup Home-made syrup Yeah like pancakes But they were so good Mhm And what kind of fillings did you use for all are they just without any filling It' you use Yeah With sour cream or with what With butter We didn't I don't know I I I didn't get into doing crepes They were always Well I'm busy from early Christmas morning They were a lot of work and I but bl' that is before lent starts But you can make them anytime Oh yeah And do you remember maybe the word for this period of time when people make a lot of Másl'enka Oh good Good good Wonderful We exactly use the same word Yeah nice And by the way today in Russia it's kind of popular Generally it's from what I heard it's considered to be Russian food Like you know pancakes are eaten with with caviar or you know fish eggs Oh yeah So it's sort of fish eggs but you never ate the like that right Caviar is so expensive I I mean fish eggs like from salmon Oh yeah Yeah but did Never no You never no I might have tried it 'cause I I did freeze myself several packages of fish eggs I've put a little bit salt in them before I've frozen them Yeah But are fish eggs you know popular today like salted fish eggs no From salmon salmon fish eggs Not as popular Not real popular But last year I did some salted recipe I got in one of the books And in Afognak what did you do with with fish eggs We used to boil them Boil them I still can eat them like that We used to boil them Aha in butter of just in the water or how did you cook it Yeah we didn' we didn't give them long Yeah sure We didn' just in the just cook them in the boiling water and salted water Yeah Good So it' that that was how they ate fish eggs in Afognak in old days right Aha And did you by the I know that crab industry today is Terrible Strong and terrible But in old days were there crabs in Afognak but I I didn't know about king crab I didn't know about them too until late fourties early fifties about the king crab or any crab really I didn't know So people just didn't catch them in Afognak They might've some like they might've We might've 'Cause I don't remember island just across What island What was Entel Marson island That was my There is a big bay no Yes We lived there and we would go out in in the summertime and in the spring and have picknicks on the beach and build a fire and reduce cans you know the big square can that are full of nice salt water and have it down the fire And my dad and us kids we'd go out and he would pick this old Dungeness crab with a pitch fork They'd be just across the the flat you know the sandy bottom And take a boiling water and we would oh it was so good with alád'iks and coffee But you don't see them anymore They're kind of all fished out But they are some So you lived in Afognak so probably you could see crabs around But people just didn't use them they didn't catch them they didn't eat them right They're Dungeness I don't know I don't remember You know like I told Bettie one time we were at the same place at the same time but we each have different memories Yeah Sure it' it's very natural It' it's always Because different family Absolutely You know different cultures Styles Yeah Absolutely Yeah yeah And one more question because there is also sort of a discrepancy between what we have today and what was in the past with mushrooms Did your when in your childhood or when you were young you stayed in Afognak did people pick mushrooms Did they cook them or I don't remember we were I know father Gerasim used to go out and take them 'cause my husband talks about the mushroom soup that used to make And I never had it I never picked mushrooms Yeah so kinda they same as with crabs People just saw them but they never picked them They never ate them Well But maybe some of the old natives maybe some of the older people that lived there earlier might have picked them I see I see We were always afraid of them because we didn't know which ones were good and which ones were not So we never ate them we didn't use them But but our kids do now you know There are some people here Pick mushrooms today No that don't I mean the Caucasian people Westerners that go out in the woods and pick the mushrooms Oh really They know yeah So there are different books from And they share sometimes mhm Mhm Yeah that's interesting So there was ever there was something that you know you could see but you never used Yeah In Afognak mhm But in Afognak and and I also wanted to ask about Ouzinkie because Ouzinkie is a pretty close village yeah And were there Russian speakers there or just generally Yeah Besides Afognak were there other places where people you know were sort of people of Russian origin resided and they could speak Russian What All around the island All in the south and everywhere Mhm Mhm so in all villages But that's probably Russia today and Russian languages that we learned probably different because their Alutiiq their dialect was a little bit different than the one in Kodial island and some other places around the island So that would probably be the same with the Russian I'm assuming that Yeah Aha but in did you have any memories kind of you know from your own experience that you went to some place to some other village and you noticed that they speak Russian but it's a bit different Ouzinkie's was pretty much the same as Afognak Aha And Kodiak But Old Harbour Akiak I don't know did you know if Larsen Bay I think Larsen Bay was kind of either Aleut or English I don't know about Kalak I think Kalak was mostly Aleut Yeah and Old Harbour Old Harbour they spoke Russian over there but it was different than the Russian we heard Mhm But the most close relationships was between Afognak and Ouzinkie I guess Mhm To my knowledge aha It's the closest place and so natural so were there intermarriages between these two villages Mhm no Not not Just a couple that I know of today you know but not way back I don't remember Were there many of relatives Like Yeah we were related Relatives yeah I I told one lady Don't give me any more relatives I have enough Enough And I' they' She was telling me who I was related to Some were if I my grandmother and I she was Jenny Pestrikoff and she said Well you are related to everybody on the island here So there and okay in Afognak there were two parts of the village Aleut town and you know the main language D'ir' For those people was the main language for was sort of Russian but both Intermingled Yeah intermingled but with Ouzinkie it was not like that There was no division like Aleut-speaking people I don't think so They just you all together Yeah I we lived there for a year In Ouzinkie Yeah And it was one just one that seemed like English and maybe Russian and some Aleut And but people in Ouzinkie they were in respect of the language It was more or less the same They they were sort of trilingual as you put it right Like you know English and also some Russian and some Aleut Mhm Is it like that That there were trilingual Mhm To a great extent Aha so but they have the families that lived in was kind of you had different last names Is it right Like in from Afognak village Anderson no there was Andersons in Afognak aha Anderson there were there were Ouzinkie The names seem more Russian to me in Ouzinkie Yeah Because they Chernoff you know Chernoff Chichenoff Kotelnikoff Kotelnikoff Yeah So there were Chichenoffs also in Ouzinkie Mhm Mhm mhm Yeah and yeah that's interesting But and were there by the way families with Aleut last name Like not Russian-sounding last names but like I don't know I don't know Aleut That's why I don' I don't Just Amachuk What' what's the name Amachuk Was was Sam Amachuk Amachuk And then Grinko was Gregory Chanyan those were the two they said when we moved over here the two two Aleut names And Lukin What Lukin is not a Aleut name Lukin Russian That' that's Russian that's Russian No it' yeah Russian aha And you thought it' it's what Lukin maybe it's if it's not Russian it would be what No that's what that's what Lukin it's Russian Yeah it is Russian Yeah it is Russian because you know but maybe there are such coincidences that you But Knagin they say that's Danish Mhm Could be And then I always thought Russian 'cause I always put when they ask what nationality what blah-blah-blah are you I put Russian and Aleut I always put that down every since I could remember Mhm mhm Yeah with Lukin I'm pretty sure that it's Russian because you know we Lukin it's like maybe Brown Mhm It's it's a very widespread name in Russia If you take the phone directory you know there will be several pages of Lukin Yeah I read that in And with Knagin it could it could be both variants because you know König it means you know king in Danish in Scandinavian languages So it could be like the Russian let's name king Aha And some spell it kanagin because there are some in Petersburg that are Knagins Kanagin Yeah could be it could be Russian It could be Russian Kanagin Yeah it' but it could be Russian but it I got Yeah Mhm And then there' I'm sorry I interrupted you yeah Oh no that's okay Then there' there is Kirwan which is that Scottish Could be Could be I've I've read it in some of the history Mhm mhm You know a book that you would probably really enjoy would be or you you may have already read it it's Derevnia's Daughters You know I heard about this book in people many people mentioned this book in Kodiak when I talked to them But I couldn't buy it because you know I checked in all the bookstores in Kodiak They don't have it because in in one store their main bookstore the girls said Oh it it was here sure Oh probably it's gone Try the museums Yeah but when I'm back to Fairbanks I'm sure they have it at university Oh yeah Or maybe I'll order it through Internet on the Internet because you know you can buy everything on the Internet Yeah But I hope they get the library That's a lot of good histories good history there And you know I' I' when I was in Kodiak I met I met a woman who actually you know it was just by accident that I joined this pilgrimage to Spruce island because I was just at that time in Kodiak And I found out that they're planning a pilgrimage and I joined other people and many people who went to Spruce island 'cause like maybe one hundred or so Yeah they do every year Three boats I think and on on Spruce island I met a woman whose name is Barney Barney Barney But she is the author she has just published the book About Kotelnikoffs Johny I think That' Her name is Barney Penmiroff Yeah probably Oh really Aha She wrote the books about the Kotelnikoff clan Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Oh really Now what is the name of that Helen It' it's called Our Kotelnikoff Journey That's what I remember Oh And then there was a subtitled like Ouzinkie something Yeah Oh really Yes yes she With photographers you know for family some places Oh I'd sure love to get that And you know it' some sell in Kodiak where do they buy it Museum an Alutiiq museum they sell it And those who sell it I think in Baranov church bookstore Monk Monk Rock Monk's Rock Monk Rocks Monk's Rock yeah It's sort of two places Yeah I liked it And it' it' she said she has just published it's so nice yeah So do you know this lady She was from Ouzinkie I know her I know her aha From Kotelnikoff Katy Kotelnikoff was her mother Mhm mhm Oh I don' I don't know Yeah interesting And who would you I'm very much interested since you're now turning to collect information on the language situation on the Russian language who would you say in your view the best Russian speakers who are left for for today Like besides Johny Pestrikoff that's for sure that he is the that's and I talked with him But he' because he has had a stroke Yeah It's hard to understand him But when he speaks Russian of course I can see that that was his first language at some point a century ago Yeah How about Katherine Chichenoff Helen did You mean Katherine who lives in Kodiak yeah Sammy's wife Sammy's wife No she's Alutiiq she speaks Aleut yeah She' yeah she speaks Alutiiq She's good She's very good but she only knows some you know Russian words How about Sammy Sammy I talked with him yeah He is a good speaker but yeah But he himself said that you know I'm not the best of course I'm not the best Yeah I can't remember something But and he mentioned If you were to go to Port Lions you would find much better speakers there but he mentioned of course Johny Pestrikoff but he doubted that I will be able to talk to him But he was fine and I met with him a couple of times And he has I think his birthday Yes On on Friday Friday and swád'ba búd'it tózha Aha The same day His granddaughter is getting married that day Same day yeah And and he mentioned your name he he said You should go to all Nelsons You should go to all Nelsons because you know they are good speakers And he also mentioned Sergei Sheretin Yes But it's kind he's sort of reluctant Mhm Yeah He is in a bad mood probably today Somebody told me that no he doesn't he's not If he doesn't want if he doesn't want to he won't do it 'cause I called him up one time when I needed help with the Alutiiq some Alutiiq words and no And he and I was not offended Yeah sure No no no I don't blame him because you know he is an old guy he's not very well Maybe it it's up to him to decide whatever It's too bad that they don't share enough I think you know that's why a lot of our our language the culture and everything is going down But with culture you surprised me so much when I heard you know that many traditions are still kept Mhm Yes that's wonderful Yeah But with language of languages they die faster than cultures Because you know these prazniks and food and everything it lasts longer But languages of course it' if English is a more prestigious languages you need more English in everyday life than Russian It's just And if you don't have someone to carry on a conversation in Russian 'cause You're right I forget but then I remind myself at home that my mind to remember some of the Mhm mhm And is your husband speaking Yes he speaks good Russian And he speaks Alutiiq too Don't let him fool you he was at the shop today So how long will you be here But you know it depends on how much how many people I can find I think that if you get to see ene too she' ene Gendelson is she good speaker She Aha Mhm-mhm Good that's wonderful And somebody mentioned I think Christine She Alutiiq Aha Not Russian not Russian Not not that I As a matter of fact I was I had to visit a couple people today and she was one of them that I was visiting Mhm So you ene Gendelson that's that would be yeah That's our sister-in-law Yeah Abner's sister Wonderful And are there any people in Ouzinkie who are speakers today You know I just am out of touch with Ouzinkie You don't know I was thinking of Nick Pestrikoff but he is more Aleut Nick Pestrikoff Yeah Mhm And how old is he He must be sixty he's in his sixties Mhm he's in his sixties yeah So and so how But he's he he really you left if you visited him you'd have to reserve about three hours Why His stories Yeah he has good stories He lo yeah he loves to talk he loves to tell stories He's a nice guy You know when this Alutiiq they tried to revive started reviving Alutiiq language but it really touched the a lot of people I remember my brother especially He's gone now He died of cancer a few years ago And he was so upset the same people that were telling him Do not speak Alutiiq on the school grounds were the ones that were all involved in this he just he just could not you know Mhm I see I'm I'm gonna try anyway I've been I've been going to the classes because because I spoke Alutiiq as a child when I was pretty into the Russian-speaking home and I I just remember a couple things in Alutiiq What is which languages of these two are more To me You feel free yeah I feel freer with the Russian With the Russian Mhm Mhm mhm Because even Wonderful When I go to the language classes go to Afognak and we start having conversations I say I I have to learn to keep my mouth shut I said That's borrowed from the Russian A lot of the words are borrowed You recognize I recognize the Russian by the way Interesting Good so so in Ouzinkie you don't think th besides Nick Pestrikoff it's proper I'm not really sure he does know Russian but Zack Chichenoff should maybe Yeah Zack Yah Sammy / Sunny Chichenoff mentioned his name but for some reason he did not advised Oh okay okay okay He said I I understand why Oh but you shouldn't you shouldn't Okay I understand the reason aha I I didn't know what he didn't tell me the reason but maybe it's kind of Yeah Maybe Zack will be also reluctant or I don't know I don't know So there are not very many people in Ouzinkie because I'm thinking whether it will make sense for me to go there or later or Is there somebody you can contact there at the tribal or the city office and ask them if they have any Russian speaking people there I think that would be your best Some of the some of the elderly ladies some of my relatives I know you know spoke Russian but they're all gone now And in our In our home in my home my mother didn't speak other she was not from Alaska she was from Oklahoma and she was Cherokee My dad my f my dad he was and raised he was born in Ouzinkie and he has a lot of relatives over there His grandmother was Pestrikoff his mother was Pestrikoff and so my mother didn't understand and he he spoke fluent Russian and Aleut So when visitors would come you know it would be spoken in the home but my mother didn't understand him Which words Those were ours I'm very much interested in words Tell me I want to hear too Yeah So an and Abner understood Russian but then I didn't so you know it was Yeah Oh yeah Your One of these guys worked you know all worked Yeah but we didn't use Ya b'izu'mnaya I used to like what his mother would say She'd say Dáy Boh sárstv'iy n'eb'ésn'iy And you know what I said Sure yeah Aha And and she'd always say Prast'í m'in'á ma *u * gr'éshn'ik'i And I thought that was the sweet those are two two sweet memories that I've had For forgive me my sins and yours Lord is a heaven on Earth And what what what mem memories Yeah She was a Mhm And yeah because I I feel uncomfortable because maybe I'm taking too much time of you because we I'm I'm read to sit you know the whole week Recording And listening and asking questions so just tell me when you're tired and I'll leave What You're looking at your watch Yeah I'm Well gotta go home and Sorry you weren't supposed to see me do that But I gotta go home and cook for my husband he'll be pretty quick Aha Mhm But will I have a chance to talk maybe again like you know maybe for asking for some words because you know what they expect from me I mean university in Fairbanks that they I record some Russian words They They're very interested in all histories What what we are talking about like you know all this information who lived where who spoke what language but you know just also some Russian maybe wor even words They're gonna say Kakóy w'et'ezh tamka What you know Wonderful Yeah Mnóga dosh yeah all these kinds of you know sen sentences about you know everything Just I'm pretty sure that you should remember because you know when you were kids probably you know there is sort of a division Boys do something and girls do something else like you know help mothers about the house or maybe collect some greens or you know whatever So I'm pretty sure that you remember a lot of words for I don't know for some herbs or I don't know Wawúl'n'ik Ah good good That's bushes And I can't remember Yeah aha aha I can't remember what they are They are quite a few of those in Russia
