Oh yes

Ir
15:20
So Swedish and Norwegian and (..) [Swedish?] 

Rt2
15:23
 [Yes] 

Ir
15:24
So there were many people from those countries in all these villages | [all ov==] 

Rt2
15:29
 [All | yes] 

Ir
15:29
All over Kodiak?

Rt1
15:30
And they married native women

Ir, Rt2
15:32
Mhm

Ir 15:33
And they were also in== in Afognak | like [Scandinavian] ==

Rt2
15:36
[Oh yes] | yes

Rt1
15:37
German too

Ir 
15:41
Who== and==

Rt1
15:42
Italian <3> 

Rt2
15:43
Yes

Ir
15:44
<3> even Italian | oh

Rt1
15:46
Mhm | twenty <3> 

Ir
15:50
So what== they | these Scandinavian speakers who married native women | they hardly spoke Russian I think | no

Rt1
15:58
I== I== I haven’t heard any of them speak Russian | they might’ve picked it up

Ir
16:05
But they== they mostly spoke English [of course?]

Rt1
16:07
 [Mhm] English

Ir
16:11
And they never learned Alutiiq or Russian | yeah?

Rt1
16:13
N=  I can’t answer this question [honestly] 

Ir
16:15
[Okay okay] 

Rt2
16:17
Yeah | they== they (uh) (..) <1> {laughs} <2> what I was gonna say (uh) (..). Oh it was== you know if== if there was a Norwegian person who married a (uh) Alutiiq (uh) spouse | one couldn’t understand the other | so it wasn’t spoken | you know | it was kind of (..)

Rt1
16:52
Sign language {laughs} 

Rt2
16:53
{laughs} 

Ir
16:54
But== yeah but I guess most people in your days already could speak English?

Rt2
16:58
Oh yes | aha


Ir
16:59
So they could speak English

Rt2
17:02
Yeah

Ir
17:03
At least some English | mhm | but == so in Russian families | I mean in those families that lived== resided in Derevnia part (uh) | was there any == some knowledge of Alutiiq in those [families?] 

Rt1
17:18
 [Mhm mhm]

Rt2
17:18
[Oh yes] 

Ir
17:19
So it was kind of==

Rt2
17:20
It was kind of==

Rt1
17:22
They were bilingual (uh). Really ‘cause they talked Russian | English and Alutiiq

Rt2
17:28
Yes

Rt1
17:29
And then some of them maybe the Scandinavian (..) lang= so (..)

Ir 
17:33
And by the way I’ve got a question with this word Alutiiq. Is it a new word or was it used in your days when you lived in Afognak | say? Did people | you know | call this language “Alutiiq”?

Rt2
17:46
No

Rt1
17:47
<2> Aleut <2>  | [Aleut is all I’ve heard] 

Ir
17:48
 [Aleut | yeah yeah yeah | Aleut | mhm mhm] 

Rt2
17:49
Yes | yes this a new something==

Ir
17:54
Yeah that’s== that’s what== yeah that’s what I also suspect

Rt3
18:00
<2> 

Ir
18:02
But I also==

Rt2
18:03
It’s okay honey

Rt3
18:06
<3> 

Rt2
18:06
Mhm

Ir 
18:07
And (..) I also heard the name Sugpiaq (*синоним к слову Alutiiq*) | but it’s kind of== it’s also a new one

Rt2
18:12
Oh that’s==

Ir
18:14
It’s something yeah? But h= so most==

Rt1
18:17
I had a hard time with that | so [I don’t know]
 

Ir 
18:20
 [Yeah yeah]. So mostly people said that it was Aleut right? Or in those days [I mean]  

Rt2
18:26
Mhm

Ir
18:27
Native language | yeah? Mhm. And you know I== I== one more question about== you know I’m trying to figure out how it worked | all these names for languages and for people and I== in many books | you know | I’ve heard about creols

Rt1
18:44
 [ <3> ] 

Ir
18:45
 [Yeah actually] could you maybe explain to me what kind of pe= did you use this word first of all?

Rt2
18:53
That’s==

Ir
18:53
In your childhood | when you were younger and stayed in Afognak? Did people use the word [„creol“] ?

Rt1
18:58
[They did]. I was called a kr’eólka and then== in a slang | you know | and then I thought | well I didn’t know what it was so I <5> 

Rt1, Rt2, Ir 
19:07
{laugh}

Rt2
19:08
It was when you==  when (..) half the family was white and half the family was Russian

Ir 
19:16
Mhm mhm

Rt2
19:17
Right (..) | because some non-Russian and Russian (..)==

Ir 
19:22
Mhm mhm mhm

Rt2
19:25
I know that’s== they== they called us too (uh) | in the schools if you were not full Aleut or full Russian | then you were creol. I just== where did I== I just read that (um)==

Rt1
19:42
Actually I have that written down on my boots <4> . My brother | he’s Aleut | you know

Ir
19:49
Really?

Rt1
19:50
{laughs} So that’s a piece of history

Rt1, Rt2 
19:51
{laugh}

Ir 
19:52
So your brother’s birth certificate == there is==

Rt1
19:55
Aleut | [Aleut] 

Ir
19:56
 [Aleut] | yeah it’s written Aleut and in your==

Rt1
19:59
It’s creol

Ir 
20:00
Creol | wow

Rt2
20:02
See | it depended on two== on the midwives

Ir
20:06
Oh aha

Rt1
20:07
And the midwife that delivered me | she didn’t know how to write because her name was written with == in mark with an “X”

Ir
20:15
Oh oh oh

Rt1
20:16
So I’ve got a piece of history in my <1> 

Rt2
20:17
 [Yeah] 

Ir
20:17
 [Yeah] | that’s wonderful. Sounds very interesting. 

Rt2
20:21
And==

Ir 
20:21
Aha

Rt2
20:22
Oh excuse me

Ir
20:23
No no no

Rt2
20:23
And some== some of the (um) babies were== their birth dates were not on the same day they were born. They were== they were recorded (..) when they were baptized. Right. Some of them.

Ir
20:45
Mhm

Rt1
20:46
Baptismal day was instead of birthday


Ir
20:49
Mhm mhm

Rt2
20:50
And so | you know | so== there (uh)== some== some are== my sister had two birthdates. And (uh) for the longest time she went (uh) by the earlier birthday <2>. When she== she applied for== {sighs} what is it? Social security I think. She was (uh) a year older she== {laughs} | her birthday== her birth certificate <3> said that she was== 

Ir
21:21
So she got a different birthday for other document | yeah

Rt 
21:26
Yeah

Ir
21:27
Interesting. And with names | I noticed that all people== actually in Afognak I guess all the people were Orthodox | right?

 Rt2
21:35
Most of

Ir
21:36
Most of them | yeah. And (uh) all Orthodox people have (uh) sort of two names. One is [American] 

Rt2
21:42
[Yes] 

Ir
21:43
And one is Russian [name]

Rt2
21:44
Mhm yeah

Ir
21:45
It’s also connected with== somehow tied up with the church

Rt1
21:48
With the church (uh) | baptismal day <2> my Russian name | like my name is Helen in English and in Russian (uh) Elena
Ir
21:56
Mhm mhm

Rt1
21:57
So and they will give <4> my sister Barbara was Barbara | so Varva= Varvara. And we’d say “Warwara” and that’s not right because proper <3> the “V” instead of the “W”. We use it== „W“ <2> in Russian quite a bit

Ir 
22:13
Mhm. Yeah interesting. And was== aha | so (uh) it’s (uh)== how== how is== how are these Russian names given? In what way== they take it from the book or==

Rt1
22:28
I know from an elder that they named you== say | well you had a relative of mostly like that. Like there was a lot of Mariyas and then== and then if they liked somebody [it was (uh) Mariya | aha]

Ir
22:41
[So it’s just <2> somebody== some] deceased relative | right?

Rt1
22:43
Or even a living one | you know | because I know someone that had been named after== the Russian given name were== after living person

Ir
22:53
Did you name== you got your name after somebody?

Rt1
22:55
Elena | my grand= one of my grandmothers

Rt2
22:59
I don’t know about mine. It’s Evgenia

Ir
23:03
Mhm. It’s exactly like my name by the way

Rt2
23:06
Oh really?

Ir
23:07
Yeah | because actually I== I== I always introduced myself as Eugene because | you know | no one can pronounce the Russian name {laughs} 

Rt2
23:17
{laughs} So the Russian== your Russian name is==

Ir
23:19
Evgeniy

Rt1
23:20
Evgeniy

It, Rt2
23:20
Evgeniy

Rt2
23:21
So that is the (uh)==

Ir
23:22
Eugene is kind of a== the most== the closest==

Rt2
23:23
So that is the (uh) male gender? Male==

Ir
23:29
Well yeah yeah | because==

Rt2
23:30
[And Evgenia is the==] 

Ir
23:30
[We use the==] we use this name both for men and women | [it’s no problem]

Rt2
23:34
[Oh really?] Oh

Ir
23:36
Evgeniy


Rt2
23:36
And he’s==

Ir
23:37
Man’s name | Evgenia would be woman’s name

Rt1, Rt2
23:39
Aha

Rt2
23:40
Yeah | Evgenia

Ir23:43
So it’s== yeah

Rt2
23:46
And if== if it’s Alexander

Ir
23:49
<3> name?

Rt2
23:49
Aha

Ir 23:50
Alexander is your==

Rt2
23:51
Rus=

Ir
23:53
Russian Orthodox name 

Rt1, Rt2
23:55
Mhm mhm

Ir
23:56
So interesting. So it’s a== it’s not that the name was taken from the church book | you know | there is character | no | it’s just to honor somebody’s memory | yeah?


Rt2
24:05
Mhm

Rt1
24:08
But they== they’ve really kept wonderful book though in the Russian Orthodox. The weddings and baptismals and (uh) births. Because when I worked (uh) at the Senior Citizens | if I needed a birth certificate I’d have to go to the Russian Orthodox <5> | he’s gone now. He would translate it from there. Everything was in Russian in their books. And he’d translate a copy for me in English.

Ir 
24:47
Mhm. So==

Rt2
24:37
And== and the state of Alaska and any other important== they== they honored the (..) the Church records | you know | so during the== when they (uh) <2> (um) started. A lot of people== a lot of older folks did not have a birth certificate. So the priest could (uh) go== they would take it from the records of the church.

Ir
25:15
And were these all Russian traditions and its== actually in Afognak | of course | I’m pretty sure that you followed all these Russian traditions and Russian calendar like an old== they have a two-week difference with (uh)==

Rt2
25:59
They celebrated both

Ir
25:31
Both

Rt1
25:32
The Russian and English (..) American

Ir
25:35
So Christmas | it’s kind of | you know | it’s later

Rt2
25:38
Yeah | January | yeah

Ir
25:41
And == so is it== Eas=

Rt2
25:46
Easter | sometimes two weeks {laughs} 

Rt1
25:48
Months sometimes {laughs}. Months | yeah

Rt2
25:51
Yeah. It’s always different (uh). But those were very important | you know | dates | holidays | Christmas and Easter

Ir
26:04
Are these two observed today? I mean all these (um) Orthodox traditions or | you know | prazniks

Rt1
26:12
They still have it. They still celebrate Easter | the Russian Orthodox. They used Starring (*
Имеется в виду рождественская традиция православного населения Аляски; аналог хождения со звездой*) | which I heard that they don’t do it anymore in Russia. They go from house to house with their star | and maybe in some places in Russia they do

Ir
26:27
(um) Hardly

Rt1
26:28
And they ca= they sing their Carols in Russian | Mnógaya l’éta

Ir
26:35
So you== you== you== do you still== do people [still do that right now?]

Rt1
26:38
[They still do that]

Ir
26:39
Oh

Rt1
26:40
They still practice it today

Ir 26:42
No more in Russia. Not== not== they don’t sing Carols | and they (..) don’t go for Starring | and Easter is a very big holiday | that’s very holy. Everybody celebrates it. It’s the biggest== you see | maybe even== in today’s Russia it’s even more sign= important that Christmas
Rt2
26:59
Yes that is with us too. Even with== you know | the (uh) y= our church | a little chapel | Easter is the biggest and most important | because Christ dies and rose again

Ir 
27:18
Yeah yeah. And so what do you do for Easter? What are== what traditions are still kept [today?]

Rt1
27:24
[They] have what is called “a holy week” at the Orthodox church. And they have==they have == a seven-days== they still practice seven weeks of lent. And they’re not as (..) strict or devout. I don’t know what word to use on that now with their (..) fasting | but some of them fast really on the last week. And then there’s lot of <3> last week | the seventh week of lent. And then they have their good variety

Ir
27:55
What was== is the Russian word for “lent”?

Rt1
21:57
Ya n’i znáyu

Ir
27:58
Mhm mhm. Could it be пост? Пост | no? Okay it’s== ít’s the modern word | пост

Rt2
28:04
What’s==

Ir 
28:05
Пост. The Great Lent is called Великий пост

Rt1
2807
Oh | W’el’ík’iy post | Pas= Pas= Páska | We celebrate [Páska] 

Rt2
28:12
[Yeah] 

Ir
28:15
And so==and do == for Easter do you make this==

Rt1
28:19
Kul’ích?
Ir 
28:21
Кулич | [yeah] 

Rt2
28:21
[Oh yes] 

Rt1
28:22
As a matter of fact <3> in my place [yesterday] 

Rt2
28:24
[Oh I too] | I did too. I got it ready for <2> {laughs}. I was going to (..) | yeah

Ir
28:32

Ir 28:36
[Yeah | mhm mhm] 

Rt1
28:37
[Colour eggs] 

Ir
28:36
It’s кулич and wh= what would be the Russian expression for (..) “colour eggs”? Eggs would be яйца

Rt1
28:48
[Yáytsi] 

Rt2
28:49
[Yeah] 


Rt1
28:50
Krásn’iye yáytsi. Ya n’i znáyu kak skazát’

Ir
28:56
Яйца. It’s exactly what you <1> | wonderful. So Easter is still the biggest holiday? And in connection with Christmas== so Starring is one important thing. It’s== it’s still observed

Rt1
29:09
It’s still observed

Ir 
29:10
Yeah mhm | great. And (uh) not only among older people but also young people?

Rt1
29:15
They have a younger generation that (..) keeping (uh)==

Rt2
29:19
Yeah

Ir 29:20
Good. And with== there is another sort of tradition which is not observed anymore in Russia | but it was observed in the past. Like Masquerading?

Rt2
29:30
Oh

Ir 
29:30
Is it==

Rt1
29:31
I didn’t see it last couple years here. But they were== they were practicing it here when I first moved over here

Rt2
29:38
Mhm

Rt1
29:39
And that was (uh)==

Rt2
29:40
That was a big thing in Afognak

Ir
29:42
In Afognak? Oh. Tell me how it worked. Ho= how was it observed? What did you do? Wha= wha= what was the point?

Rt2
29:48

Rt3
30:27

Ir
30:29
Mhm

Rt2
30:30
Would you like more coffee to== 

Ir
30:31
No thank you | thank you

Rt2
30:32
Okay

Ir
30:32
And so== so what was the point? People change their dress | put on some== what == costume

Rt2
30:44
Oh yes

Ir
30:45
How==

Rt2
30:46
And they were nice. They were nice costumes. They weren’t like today’s

Ir
3049
So you were getting ready. You were preparing them | [in advance] 

Rt2
30:55
[On that day they would] have it== dance. They would dance | you know. [They were dancers] 

Ir
30:57
[It was kind of costumes]. It was kind of | you know | it’s up to you to [<2> prepare] 

Rt2
31:01
[Yeah | aha] 

Rt1
31:02
Is== I remember before this they used to have these really nice screen masks with the facial== face that had your nose and then your eyes. And then they’d wear a cloak underneath that and then have room for their breathing and stuff. And == and they went from house to house and then they’d have a dance ‘cause we were allowed to go to dances (uh) with== the parents take the children there and we’d sit aside on benches watching the masqueraders.

Ir
31:32
Mhm. But you yourself did not participate? You’re==

Rt1
31:34
No | as we grew older we did

Ir
31:37
Older

Rt1
31:37
Aha. But (..) I’ve never have gotten into it that much

Rt2
31:41
Yeah

Ir
31:42
Did you get any gifts? (uh) <2>== small <1> coming from house to house | what should==

Rt1
31:50
You know | on Masquerading I don’t== I don’t remember

Rt2
31:56
No | they== oh well. Remember mister Petyalin used to give out oranges | apples | soda pop (uh)?

Rt1
32:10
Is that during the [Masquerading time?]

Rt2
32:11
[Some=] sometimes

Rt1
32:15
I’m not s= I know on Christmas time they did

Rt2
32:16
Maybe

Ir
32:16
Mhm. On Christmas?

Rt2
32:17
Yeah | maybe it was (uh)==

Rt1
32:19
And then the one that was a star bearer. Whoever owned the star | they’d slip ‘em | you know | they didn’t have too much money | then they’d give them | whether it’d be a dollar or five dollars. Just (..) appreciation

Ir
32:33
Mhm mhm. And so | whe= when== during this Masquerading it was kind of | you know | sort of a team or== of people who==

Rt1
32:39
Different groups went==

Ir
32:41
[Different groups] 

Rt1
32:42
[Aha]. There were several groups

Rt2
3243
And they visited from house to house

Rt1
32:45
Mhm

Ir
32:46
So and you (uh) were under disguise. People couldn’t recognize [you].

48:00
[Yeah] 

Ir 48:01
[With] sour cream or with what? With butter or==

Rt2
48:06
We didn’t. I don’t know. I ne= I ne= I didn’t get into doing crepes. They were always {laughs} 

Rt1
48:14
Well I== I’m busy [from early Christmas morning]

Rt2
48:16
[They were a lot of work] {laughs} | and I just== but bl’iní== we== that is before lent starts. But you can make them anytime

Ir
48:32
Oh yeah. And do you remember maybe the word for this period of time when people make a lot of блины? 

Rt1
48:43
Másl’enka

Ir
48:43
Oh good. Good good. Wonderful. We exactly use the same word. Масленка. Yeah nice. And by the way today in Russia it’s kind of popular. Generally it’s from what I heard | it’s considered to be Russian food. Like you know | pancakes | блины | are eaten with (uh) == with caviar or [you know | fish eggs] 

Rt2
49:06
[Oh yeah] 

Ir
49:07
So it’s sort of fish eggs | but di= di= you never eat== ate the like that | right? With==

Rt1, Rt2
49:16
{laugh} Caviar is so expensive

Ir
49:18
I mean== I mean fish eggs | like from salmon

Rt2
49:19
Oh yeah

Ir
49:20
Yeah | but did you==

Rt2
49:21
Never | no

Ir
49:23
You never (..) no

Rt1
49:25
I might have tried it ‘cause I did= I did freeze myself several packages of fish eggs. I’ve put a little bit salt in them before I’ve frozen them

Rt2
49:30
Yeah

Ir
49:31
But (uh) are fish eggs | you know | popular today | like salted fish eggs | no? From salmon | [salmon fish eggs] 

Rt2
49:38
[Not as popular] 

Rt2
49:40
Not real popular. But last year I did some salted <4> recipe I got in one of the books

Ir
49:50
And in Afognak what did you do with (uh) with fish eggs?

Rt2
49:58
We used to [boil them] 

Rt1
49:59
[Boil them]. [I still can eat them like that] 

Rt2
50:00
[We used to boil them]. Aha

Ir
50:03
I= in butter of just in the water or how== how did you cook it? 

Rt2
50:08
Yeah we didn’t== we didn’t give them long

Ir
50:10
Yeah sure

Rt2
50:11
We didn’t== just== just in the sack== just cook them in the boiling water and salted water. Yeah

Ir
50:19
Good. So it’s== that was== that was how they ate (uh) fish eggs in Afognak in old days | right?

Rt2
50:28
Aha

Ir
50:29
And did you by the way== I know that crab industry today is very==

Rt1
50:33
Terrible

Ir
50:34
Strong {laughs} | and terrible

Rt2, Ir
50:36
{laughs}

Ir
50:37
But in old days | were there crabs in Afognak?

Rt2
50:42
<3> but I did== I didn’t know about king crab or==

Rt1
50:48
I didn’t know about them too until late fourties | early fifties | about the king crab | or any crab really. I didn’t know

Ir
50:55
So people just didn’t catch them in Afognak?

Rt1
5058
They might’ve | some like <3> | they might’ve

Rt2
51:01
[We might’ve] 

Rt1
51:02
[‘Cause I don’t remember] 

Rt2
51:03
<9> island just across the==

Ir
51:08
What island? [What was the==] 

Rt2
51:10
Entel Marson island. That was my grand=

Ir
51:13
There is a big bay | no?

Rt2
51:16
Yes. We lived there and my== we would go out in (uh) in the summertime and in the spring and have picknicks on the beach and build a fire and reduce <3> cans | you know the big square can | that are full of nice salt water and (..) have it down the fire. And my dad and us kids | we’d go out and he would pick this old Dungeness crab with a pitch fork. They’d be just <1> across the (uh) the flat | you know | (..) the sandy bottom. And (uh) take== take a <4> boiling water | and we would just== oh it was so good | with alád’iks {laughs} and coffee. But you don’t see them anymore. They’re kind of all fished out. But they== they are some good==

Ir
52:18
So you lived in Afognak | so probably you could see crabs around. But people just didn’t use them | they didn’t catch them | they didn’t eat them | right?

Rt2
52:28
They’re Dungeness | I don’t know

Rt1
52:30
I= I= I don’t remember. You know | like I told Bettie one time | we were at the same place at the same time | but we each have different memories

Rt2
52:39
[Yeah] 

Ir
52:39
[Sure] | it’s== it’s very natural. It’s== it’s always like==

Rt2
52:41

Because different family

Ir
52:42
Absolutely

Rt2
52:43
You know different [cultures]

Rt1
52:43
[Styles]

Rt2
52:44
Yeah

Ir
52:45
Absolutely. Yeah yeah. And with== one more question because there is also sort of a discrepancy between what we have today and what was in the past (uh) with mushrooms. Did your people== when you== in your childhood or when you were young | you stayed in Afognak | did people pick mushrooms? Did they cook them or (..)

Rt2
53:07
I don’t remember | [we were always==] 

Rt1
53:08
[I know father Gerasim] used to go out and take them ‘cause my husband talks about the mushroom soup that used to make. And I never t= had it. I never picked mushrooms 

Ir
53:17
Yeah so kinda they <2> people== same as with crabs. People just saw them but they never picked them. They never [ate them] 

Rt2
53:24
[Well] 

Rt1
53:25
But maybe some of the old natives | maybe some of the older people that lived there earlier might have (uh) picked them

Ir
53:34
I see | [I see] 

Rt2
53:35
[We were] always afraid of them because we didn’t know which ones were good and which ones were not. So we never ate them | we didn’t use them. But they== but (uh) our kids do now | you know. They==

Rt1
53:50 
There are some people here that==

Ir
53:51
Pick mushrooms today?

Rt1
53:52
No | that don’t speak== I mean the== the Caucasian people | Westerners that go out in the woods and pick the mushrooms

Ir
53:59
Oh really?

Rt2
54:00
They know | yeah

Ir
54:01
So they== [there are different books from some==] 

Rt2
54:02
[And they share sometimes] | mhm

Ir
54:05
Mhm, Yeah that’s interesting. So (uh) there was ever some= something== there was something that | you know | you could see but you never used

Rt2
54:15
Yeah

Ir 
54:16
In Afognak | mhm. But in Afognak (uh)== and yeah== and I also wanted to ask about Ouzinkie because Ouzinkie is a pretty close village yeah? And (uh) were there Russian speakers there or just generally? [Besides==] 

Rt1
54:31
[Yeah] 

Ir
54:32
Besides Afognak were there other places where people you know were sort of (..) people of Russian origin resided and they could speak Russian? Wh= [What was==] 

Rt1
54:42
[All around] the island

Ir
54:44
All in the south and everywhere?

Rt2
54:47
Mhm

Ir
54:48
Mhm | so in all villages?

Rt1
54:50
But that’s probably like== Russia== Russia today and Russian== Russian languages that we learned | probably different because their Alutiiq | their dialect was a little bit different than the one in Kodial island and some other places around the island. So that would probably be the same with the Russian | I’m assuming that

Rt2
55:09
Yeah

Ir 
55:09
Aha. So== but in your== did you have any memories kind of | you know | from your own experience | that you went to some place | to some other village | and you noticed that they speak Russian but it’s a bit different or==

Rt1
55:24
Ouzinkie’s was pretty much the same as Afognak

Rt2
55:28
Aha. And Kodiak. But Old Harbour | Akiak | I don’t know if== if== did you know if Lars= Larsen Bay and== I think Larsen Bay was kind of either Aleut or English. I don’t know about Kalak  (*поселение на р.Юкон на Аляске*). I think Kalak was mostly Aleut

Ir
55:51
Yeah (uh) and Old Harbour?

Rt2
55:52
Old Harbour spoke== they spoke Russian over there but it was different than the Russian we heard

Ir
56:01
Mhm. But the most close relationships was between Afognak and Ouzinkie I guess?

Rt1
56:06
Mhm. To my knowledge | aha

Ir
56:09
It’s the closest place and so natural (..)== so were there intermarriages between these two (..) villages?

Rt2
56:15
Mhm (..) no

Ir
56:18
Not | not

Rt1
56:19
Just a couple that I know of today in== you know | but not way back | I don’t remember

Ir
56:23
Were there many of relatives? Like (uh)==

Rt1
56:26
Yeah we were related {chuckles} 

Rt2
56:27
Relatives | yeah {chuckles} 

Rt1
56:28
I told== I told one lady “Don’t give me any more relatives. I have enough”

Rt2, Ir
56:32
 {laugh} 


Rt2
56:35
Enough. And I’ve== they’ve==

Rt1
56:37
She was telling me who I was related to

Rt2, Ir
56:38
{laugh} 

Rt2
56:40
Some were <4> if I (uh)== who== my grandmother was== and I said== she was Jenny Pestrikoff and she said “Well you== you are related to everybody on the island here”

Ir, Rt2
56:58
 {laugh}

Ir
57:01
So there was== and | okay | in Afognak there were two parts of the village | Aleut town and | you know | [the main language] 

Rt2
57:08
[D’ir’éw=] 

Ir
57:09
For those people was Aleut== the main language for деревня was sort of Russian | and== but both (uh)==

Rt2
57:16
Intermingled

Ir
57:17
Yeah intermingled. And== but f= with Ouzinkie it was not like that. There was no division like (..) Aleut-speaking [people] 

Rt2
57:23
[I don’t] think so

Ir
57:24
They just | you know==

Rt2
57:25
We==

Ir
57:26
All== all== all== all together

Rt2
57:28
Yeah I lived== we lived there for a year and==

Ir
57:31
In Ouzinkie?

Rt2
57:32
Yeah. And it was all== one | just one that seemed like (..) English and maybe Russian | and some Aleut

Ir
57:43
And so== but people in Ouzinkie also== they were in respect of the language. It was more or less the same. They both== they were sort of trilingual as you put it | right? Like you know (uh) | English and also some Russian and some Aleut

Rt2
58:02
Mhm

Ir
58:03
Is it like that? That there were trilingual to==

Rt1
58:06
Mhm

Ir
58:07
To a great extent. Aha so and== but they have the families that lived in Ouzinkie== was kind of | you know== had different last names. Is it right? Like in == from== from Afognak village?

Rt2
58:20
Anderson (..) no there was Andersons in Afognak

Ir
58:25
Also== [aha] 

Rt2
58:25
[Anderson] | (uh) there were no== there were (uh) Ouzinkie [names==] 

Rt1
58:29
[The names] seem more Russian to me in Ouzinkie

Rt2
58:31
[Yeah] 

Rt1
58:31
[Because] they h= Andr= Chernoff | you know

Rt2
58:34
<3> | Chernoff | Chichenoff

Rt1
58:36
Kotelnikoff

Rt2
58:37
Kotelnikoff

Rt2
58:40
Yeah

Ir
58:40
So there== there were Chichenoffs also in Ouzinkie?

Rt1, Rt2
58:44
[Mhm] 

Ir
58:45
Mhm mhm. Yeah | and (uh) yeah that’s interesting. But (uh)== and were there by the way Aleut== families with Aleut last name? Like not Russian-sounding last names but Aleut== like | I don’t know | I don’t know Aleut. That’s why I don’t== I don’t <2>

Rt
59:05
Just one==

Rt2
59:06
Amachuk

Ir
59:09
What’s== what’s the name? Am= Am=

Rt2
59:12
Amachuk. Was that== was that==

Rt1
59:15
Sam Am= Amachuk

Rt2
59:16
Ama= Amachuk

Rt1
59:17
And then Gri= Grinko was Gregory Chanyan | those were the two that== they said when we moved over here | the two Aleut== two Aleut names

Rt2
59:27
And (uh) Lukin? What about==

Rt1
59:29
Lukin is not a (..) Aleut name

Ir
59:31
Luk= Luk= Lukin

Rt2
59:32
Russian

Ir
59:33
[That’s== that’s Russian | that’s Russian]

Rt1
59:33
[No it’s== yeah | Russian] | aha

Ir
59:35
And you thought it’s== it’s what? Lukin maybe | it’s not== if it’s not Russian it would be what?


Rt1
59:42
No that’s what I== that’s what I== Lukin | it’s Russian

Rt2
59:45
Yeah | it is [Russian] 

Ir
59:46
[Yeah it is Russian] because | you know == but maybe there are such coincidences that | you know==

Rt1
59:51
But Knagin | they say that’s Danish

Ir
59:55
Mhm. Could be

Rt1
59:56
And then I always thought (..) Russian ‘cause I always put down== when they ask for== what== what nationality | what blah-blah-blah are you | I put Russian and Aleut. I always put that down | every since I could remember

Ir
1:00:08
Mhm mhm. Yeah (..) with Lukin I’m pretty sure that it’s Russian because | you know | we have== Lukin | it’s like maybe Brown

Rt1
1:00:18
Mhm

Ir
1:00:18
It’s (uh)== it’s a very widespread name in Russia {laughs} 

Rt1
1:00:21
Because==

Ir
1:00:21
If you take the phone directory | you know | there will be several pages of Lukin {laughs} 

Rt2
1:00:26
Yeah I read that in (uh)==

Ir
1:00:29
And with Knagin it could be== it could be both variants because | you know | (..) k= “König” | it means | you know | king in Danish | in Scandinavian languages. So it could be like== like the Russian | let’s name | “king”

Rt1
1:00:45
Aha. And some spell it “kanagin” | because there are some in Petersburg that are Knagins

Ir
1:00:53
Kanagin. Yeah | could be. It== it could be Russian. It could be Russian | Kanagin. Yeah it’s== but if== it could be Russian but it could==

Rt1
1:01:01
I got <8>

Ir, Rt1, Rt2
1:01:03
{laugh}

Ir
1:01:06
Yeah. Mhm. And==

Rt2
1:01:08
And then there’s==

Ir
1:01:08
I’m sorry I interrupted you | yeah

Rt2
1:01:10
Oh no that’s okay. (um) (..) Then there’s== there is Kirwan (*фамилия ирландского происхождения*) | which == is that Sco= Scottish? (um)

Ir
1:01:24
Could be

Rt2
1:01:54
I== I== Could be. I== I’ve hea= I’ve read it in some of the history

Ir
1:01:30
Mhm mhm. 

Rt2
1:01:33
You know (um) a book that you would probably really enjoy would be (..) or you may== you may have already read it | it’s “Derevnia’s Daughters”

Ir
1:01:45
You know | I heard about (uh) this book in the== people == many people mentioned this book in Kodiak when I talked to them. But I couldn’t buy it because | you know | I checked in all the bookstores in Kodiak. They don’t have it because in == in one store | their main bookstore | (uh) the girls said “Oh it was== it was here | sure. Oh probably it’s gone”

Rt2
1:02:08
{laughs} 

Rt1
1:02:09
Try the museums

Ir
1:02:10
Yeah but I== when I’m back to Fairbanks | they== I’m sure they have it at university

Rt2
1:02:12
Oh yeah

Ir
1:02:14
Or maybe I’ll order it through Internet | on the Internet | because | you know | you can buy everything on the Internet

Rt2
1:02:20
Yeah

Ir
1:02:21
But I hope they [ get <3> the library ] 

Rt2
1:02:02
[That’s a lot of good histories] | good history there

Ir
1:02:28
And you know | I’m== I’m== when I was in Kodiak | I met (uh)== I met a woman who == actually you know | it was just by accident that I joined this pilgrimage (..) to Spruce island | because I was just a= at that time in Kodiak. And I found out that they’re planning a pil= pilgrimage | and I joined other people and many people who went to Spruce island | ‘cause like | maybe one hundred or so

Rt2
1:02:56
[Yeah they do every year] 

Ir
1:02:56
[Three boats | I think] and on== on== in== on that== on Spruce island I met (uh) a woman whose name is Barney | Barney. Barney. But she is the author | she has just published the book

Rt1
1:03:12
About <3>?

Ir
1:03:13

Rt1
1:03:14
(uh) Her name is (uh) Barney Penmiroff

Ir
1:03:17
[Yeah probably] 

Rt2
1:03:18
[Oh really?] 

Rt1
1:03:19
Aha. She wrote the books about the Kotelnikoff clan

Ir
1:03:21
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Rt2
1:03:22
Oh really? Now what is the name of that | [Helen?] 

Ir
1:03:26
[It’s==] it== it’s called “Our Kotelnikoff Journey”. That’s what I remember

Rt2
1:03:30
Oh

Ir
1:03:30
And then there was a subtitled (..) like Ouzinkie something. Yeah

Rt2
1:03:34
[Oh really?] 

Rt1
1:03:34
[Yes yes]. She== she wrote==

Ir
1:03:36
With photographers | you know | for family | [some places] 

Rt2
1:03:39

Ir
1:03:41
And | you know | it’s== some sell in Kodiak in== in== where do they buy it (..)

Rt2
1:03:50
[Museum?] 

Ir
1:03:51

Rt2
1:03:55
[Baranov mus=] 

Ir
1:03:55
[Church==] church bookstore. Monk (..)

Ir
1:04:02
[Monk Rocks] | Monk’s Rock | yeah. It’s sort of two places

Rt2
1:04:07
Yeah I liked it

Ir
1:04:08
And it’s== it’s== I== I== she said she has just published | it’s (uh) so nice | yeah. So you== do you know this lady? She was [<2> from Ouzinkie]

Rt1
1:04:15

Ir
1:04:17
From Kotelnikoff

Mhm mhm

Rt2
1:04:21
Oh I don’t== I don’t know

Ir
1:04:22
Yeah interesting. And wh= who would you say== I’m very much interested since you’re now turning to collect information on== on== on the language situation | on the Russian language | (uh) who would you say (uh) in your view the best (uh) Russian speakers who are left for == {laughs} for today? Like besides Johny Pestrikoff | that’s for sure that he is (uh) the oldest== that’s why== and I talked with him. But he’s== because he has a== had a stroke

Rt1
1:05:00
Yeah

Ir
1:05:00
It’s hard to understand him. But when he speaks Russian | of course I can (..) see that that was his first language at some point | a century ago {laughs}. Yeah [but==] 

Rt2
1:05:12
[How] about Katherine (..) Chichenoff? Helen | did she==

Rt2
1:05:29
How about Sammy?

Ir
1:05:31
Sammy | I talked with him | yeah. He is a good speaker but yeah (uh). But he himself said that | you know | “I’m not the best of course”

Rt2
1:05:41
{laughs} 

Ir
1:05:41
“I’m not the best. Yeah I can’t remember something”. But (uh)== and (uh) he mentioned “If you were to go to Port Lions you would find much better speakers there”.

Ir, Rt2
1:05:51
{laugh} 

Ir
1:05:53
And== but he mentioned of course Johny Pestrikoff | but he doubted that I will be able to talk to him. But he was fine and I met with him a couple of times. And he has | I think | his birthday

Rt2
1:06:04
Yes

Ir, Rt1, Rt2
1:06:21
 {laugh}

Ir
1:06:23
“You should go to all Nelsons because | you know | they are good speakers”. And he also mentioned Sergei Sheretin

Rt2
1:06:30
Yes

Ir
1:06:32
But it’s kind of== he’s sort of reluctant

Rt1
1:06:34
Mhm

Rt2
1:06:35
Yeah

Ir 
1:06:35
He is in a bad mood probably today. Somebody told me that he== no | he== he== he doesn’t [fee= he’s not like==] 

Rt1
1:06:41
[If he doesn’t want] | if he doesn’t want to | he won’t do it ‘cause I called him up one time when I needed help with the Alutiiq | some Alutiiq words | and he== no. And he did== and I was not offended | because==

Ir
1:06:50
Yeah sure. No no no I don’t blame him because | you know | he is an old guy | he’s not very well. Maybe it sh= it’s up to him to decide (..) whatever

Rt2
1:07:02
It’s too bad that they don’t share enough. I think | you know | that’s why a lot of our == our language | the culture and everything is going down

Ir
1:07:12
But with culture you surprised me so much when I heard | you know | that many traditions are still kept

Rt1
1:07:18
Mhm

Rt2
1:07:18
Yes

Ir
1:07:19
That= that’s wonderful

Rt2
1:07:20
Yeah

Ir
1:07:21
But with language of course== languages | they die (..) faster than cultures. Because | you know | these prazniks and food and everything | it== it lasts longer. But languages | of course | it’s== if English is a more prestigious languages you need more English in everyday life than Russian. It’s just for==

Rt1
1:07:42
And if you don’t have someone to carry on a conversation in Russian | ‘cause I==

1:07:53
Mhm mhm. And i= is your husband speaking?

Rt1
1:08:05
He== he was at the shop today. So how long will you be here?

Ir
1:08:07
But you know | it depends on how (..) much (uh) how many people I can s= find 

Rt1
1:08:12
I think that if you get to see Irene (..) too | she’s==

Ir 
1:08:15
Irene Gendelson? He== is she (uh) good [speaker?] 

Rt2
1:08:17

Rt1
1:08:27
She (..) Alutiiq
Ir
1:08:30
Aha
Ir
1:08:31

Rt1
1:08:31
Not == not that I == As a matter of fact I was == I had to visit a couple people today and she was one of them (..) that I was visiting
Ir

Mhm. So you == Irene Gendelson | that’s == that would be | yeah?
Rt1
1:08:44
That’s our sister-in-law.
Rt2
1:08:48
Yeah. Abner’s sister
Ir
1:08:49
Wonderful. And are there any people in Ouzinkie who are speakers today?
Rt2
1:08:54
You know | I just am out of touch with Ouzinkie
Ir
1:09:00
You don’t know
Rt2
1:09:03
I was thinking of (uh) Nick Pestrikoff but he is more Aleut
Ir
1:09:10
Nick Pestrikoff?
Rt2
1:09:11
Yeah
Ir
1:09:12

His stories

Rt2

Rt1
1:09:47
You know when this Alutiiq ==they (..) tried to revive == started reviving Alutiiq language | but it really touched the <3> a lot of people. I remember my brother especially. He’s gone now. He died of cancer a few years ago. And he was so upset | the same people that were telling him “Do not speak Alutiiq on the school grounds” were the ones that were all involved in this | he just == he just could not | you know | (..)

Ir
1:10:20
Mhm. I see

Rt1
1:10:22
<3> I’m == I’m gonna try anyway. I’ve been == I’ve been going to the classes because because (..) I spoke Alutiiq as a child when I was pretty into the Russian-speaking home and I == I just remember a couple things in Alutiiq

Ir
1:10:36
What is (uh) == which languages of these two are more ==

Rt1

With the Russian?

Rt1
1:10:46
Mhm

Ir

Rt1
Because (..) [even] ==

Ir
1:10:48
[Wonderful]

Rt1
1:10:49
When I go to the language classes | go to <1> Afognak | and we start having conversations I say “I ==I have to learn to keep my mouth shut” | I said “That’s borrowed from the Russian”. A lot of the words are borrowed

Ir
1:11:05
You recognize ==

Rt1
1:11:06
I recognize the Russian by the way

Ir
1:11:08
Interesting. Good | so (uh) ==so in Ouzinkie you don’t think th == besides Nick Pestrikoff [it’s (uh) proper <2>]

Rt2
1:11:17
[I’m not really sure] he does know Russian (..) | but (uh)

Rt1
1:11:22
Zack Chichenoff should | maybe

Rt2
1:11:25
Yeah

Rt1
1:1126

Ir
1:11:41

Rt1
1:11:45
Yeah

Ir

Maybe Zack will be also reluctant or I [don’t know]


Rt2
1:11:50
[I don’t know]

Ir
1:11:52
So there are not very many people in Ouzinkie | because I’m thinking whether it (..) will make sense for me to go there or (uh) later or ==


Rt1
1:12:02
Is there somebody you can contact there at the tribal or the city office and ask them | if they have any Russian speaking people there? I think that would be your best [<3>]

Rt2
1:12:11
[Some of the] == some of the elderly ladies | some of my relatives | (uh) I know (uh) | you know | spoke Russian but (..) they’re all gone now. And in our == In our home | in my home my mother didn’t speak other == she was not from Alaska | she was from Oklahoma | and she was Cherokee *имеется в виду индейский народ из коренного населения Северной Америки* My dad == my f = my dad | he was and raised == he was born in Ouzinkie | and he has <2> a lot of relatives over there (um). His grandmother was Pestrikoff | his mother was Pestrikoff and (uh) == so my (uh) mother didn’t understand and he == he spoke (..) fluent Russian and Aleut. So when visitors would come | you know | it would be spoken in the home | but my mother didn’t understand him {laughs}. So they both just spoke English to us. And us kids (uh) (..) learned some words we (..) were not allowed to use {laughs}

Ir
